SUMMARY POINTS
GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)
distinguishes between two types of indirectness: indirect comparisons from
network meta-analyses and indirectness related to PICO (population, intervention,
comparison, outcome) elements; the latter is the focus of Core GRADE
Indirectness arises when a mismatch occurs between PICO elements in the
clinical question (the target PICO) and PICOs of the studies constituting the best
available evidence
When certainty of direct evidence is low, Core GRADE users should consider a
formal search for indirect evidence
Possible mismatches between the target population and the studies’
populations include differences in age, changes in population over time, and
differences in a condition or disease
Possible mismatches between the target intervention and comparator and
those of the studies’ include the intensity or duration of the intervention and a
comparator that represents suboptimal care
Possible mismatches between target and studies’ outcomes include duration of
follow-up and, of most concern, use of a surrogate outcome

search for direct evidence or a
deliberate search for indirect evidence,
for each substantial difference between
target and study PICO, Core GRADE
users must judge the likelihood that
magnitude of effects will differ
substantially. The greater the likelihood
of substantial differences the more
advisable rating down for indirectness.
This is the fifth paper in a series describing Core
GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation), the essentials of
applying GRADE to the conduct and evaluation of
systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines, and
health technology assessments addressing the effects
of interventions. In the previous articles we presented
an overview of the Core GRADE process1 and discussed
specific aspects of imprecision,2 inconsistency,3 and
risk of bias.4 This paper deals with the issue of what
Core GRADE refers to as indirectness, and presents
in sequence: the two types of indirectness—indirect
comparisons and indirectness related to population,
intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO)
issues; the different importance of indirectness in
systematic reviews, guidelines, and health technology
assessments; how to distinguish indirectness from
inconsistency; indirectness that arises in searching
for direct evidence versus relevant indirect evidence;
due attention to indirect evidence; and examples of the
various sources of indirectness.
The information in this article will enable Core GRADE
users to understand two types of indirectness—indirect
comparisons and indirectness related to PICO issues;
distinguish indirectness encountered in two scenarios—
in the search for direct evidence (which typically does
not warrant rating down for indirectness) and in the
deliberate search for indirect evidence (which typically
warrants considering the issue of indirectness); and
identify and evaluate the extent of indirectness related
to concerns that arise for each PICO element.

label indirect comparisons, the interest is in the
relative merits of intervention A versus intervention
B but evidence comes not from direct or head-to-head
comparisons of A versus B but rather of A versus C
and B versus C comparisons.6 In this approach, for
instance, if A does far better against C than does B,
superiority of A over B is inferred.
Over the past 15 years, indirect comparisons have
been almost entirely restricted to network metaanalyses that jointly consider multiple interventions
and comparators. Core GRADE focuses on direct
comparisons of a single intervention with a single
comparator. This article will therefore not deal further
with indirect comparisons but instead will focus on
indirectness related to PICO issues.

Indirectness related to PICO issues
The Core GRADE approach begins with identifying a
clinical question of interest and specifying the PICO.
We refer to the clinical question of interest as the target
PICO.
We define indirectness as a mismatch between the
target PICO and the current best evidence. Research
studies provide direct evidence for the population as
enrolled, the intervention and comparison provided
or used by the study participants, and outcomes as
measured by investigators—the PICO elements in the
study as carried out.
The study as carried out may not be the study as
planned. Investigators may have sought a heterogenous
population but enrolled only low risk patients,
anticipated high adherence to the intervention and
found only low adherence, anticipated one standard
of care in the comparator but observed another, or
planned a long follow-up but found that a funding
shortfall necessitated a short follow-up. The mismatch
between this direct evidence in the study as carried
out and the target PICO can occur in any of the four
elements of PICO. Henceforth, when we use the term
indirectness, we will be referring to indirectness
related to the target PICO rather than to indirect
comparisons.
2

Indirectness versus inconsistency
Core GRADE users must attend to the possibility that
intervention effects between their target PICO and
available evidence will differ, requiring rating down for
indirectness. On the one hand, if they have no reason
to believe that relative effects differ between men and
women, different drug doses, or outcomes measured
over one versus three years, they will be unconcerned
about applying results to women when most evidence
comes from men, a higher dose when evidence comes
from a lower dose, or three year outcomes when
evidence comes from follow-up at one year. When, on
the other hand, they believe relative effects are likely to
differ, they will have concerns about indirectness.
We have dealt with this central issue—whether
effects differ across subgroups of patients and
interventions—in our overview of Core GRADE1 and
in our article addressing inconsistency.3 In the latter,
we noted that when systematic reviewers plan to use
broad PICOs in their question definition (as should
usually be the case), they must be prepared to face large
differences in effects across studies. This preparation
involves generating a priori hypotheses for possible
explanations of inconsistency, and subsequently
testing these hypotheses.
How do these issues of inconsistency and issues
of indirectness differ? If we have evidence from both
elderly people and younger people, low dose and high
dose, or long follow-up and short follow-up, we can
test whether effects differ across these variables. We
label such situations as potential inconsistency and
ultimately consider whether results suggest different
effects between subgroups, and, if they do, evaluate
the credibility of possible subgroup effects.3 7
However, if Core GRADE users are interested in effects
in elderly people but all or almost all evidence comes
from younger people, in low dose but all or almost all
evidence comes from high dose, or in long follow-up
but all or almost all evidence comes from short followup, they lack the data to test whether effects differ
across these variables. Under these circumstances,
they must use the indirect evidence from the younger
people, the high dose, and the short follow-up to

Indirect comparisons

Indirectness concerns in guidelines and health
technology assessments versus in systematic reviews
When researchers conduct systematic reviews
independently from health technology assessments or
guidelines, they can establish eligibility criteria that
closely fit their target PICO and restrict their inclusion
criteria accordingly. As a result, indirectness is not
often a major concern in such reviews.
Health technology assessment practitioners and
guideline developers must, in contrast, address
questions of current interest to patients and clinicians.
They choose, or are presented with, questions of
sometimes urgent relevance to these target audiences.
They must therefore identify and summarise the
current best evidence to address those questions, even
if that evidence represents a poor or limited match to
their target PICO.

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING

Indirectness in two scenarios
Encountered during search for direct evidence
A search for direct evidence sometimes yields evidence
with some degree of indirectness involving one or
more of the four PICO elements. Patients may be older
or younger than the target population, have a different
ethnic background, or have a different distribution of
comorbidities.
Such differences typically do not warrant rating
down for indirectness. The reason, as we have pointed
out in previous papers in this series, is that true
subgroup effects related to such characteristics are
uncommon. Differences in baseline risk of adverse
or desirable outcomes, including differences in
comorbidity, seldom result in differences in relative
effect.8-12
However, there are particular situations in which
serious indirectness exists in studies that prove eligible
in a search for direct evidence. Such situations include
non-adherence to interventions, studies that focus on
surrogate rather than on patient important outcomes,
and problematic comparators.
When deliberately searching for indirect evidence
When direct evidence that matches their target PICO is
unavailable or of very low or low certainty, Core GRADE
users may fall back on evidence that substantially
differs from their target PICO. When Core GRADE users
deliberately search for indirect evidence, they will
inevitably confront the possibility of rating down the
certainty of evidence for indirectness.
Neglect of indirect evidence
Developers of clinical practice guidelines sometimes
mistakenly conclude that no evidence exists for a PICO
of interest. Very low quality evidence may, however, be
available simply from clinical experience. Moreover,
clinicians may often be considering an intervention
because of evidence of its usefulness in related
conditions—that is, indirect evidence. Consider, for
instance, the repurposing of interventions at the onset
of the covid-19 pandemic. The misguided enthusiasm
for hydroxychloroquine13 and ivermectin14 highlights
the limitations of such indirect evidence and thus the
cautious inferences that it demands.
Indirect evidence may, even after rating down for
indirectness has been considered, offer low or even
moderate certainty. Even if such evidence offers only
very low certainty, however, it remains preferable to
making conclusions or decisions based on no evidence.
Nevertheless, guideline developers sometimes neglect
to consider indirect evidence. For example, a guideline
panel may conclude there is no evidence for a potential
the bmj | BMJ 2025;389:e083865 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-083865

intervention in children. They will often, however, be
thinking exclusively of direct evidence. They may, as
paediatricians would likely do in their clinical practice,
be able to utilise indirect evidence from adults. In
another example, early in the covid-19 pandemic, no
direct evidence for several interventions existed, but
indirect evidence from related conditions (eg, patients
critically ill with acute respiratory distress syndrome
but without covid-19) was available and provided
support for guideline recommendations.15
Guideline developers who are not clear on the
concept may use indirect evidence without explicitly
labelling what they are doing. A study that evaluated
guideline recommendations labelled as expert opinion
found that most of these recommendations were in fact
based on indirect evidence.16
Bearing in mind the possibility of indirect evidence,
guideline developers and health technology assessment
practitioners, when formulating search strategies
for questions in which they anticipate sparse direct
evidence, should seriously consider systematically
searching for available indirect evidence that might
inform their recommendations. Experts on the review
team may be aware of the likelihood of finding relevant
indirect evidence, and their advice may bear on the
advisability of conducting the search.

Examples of indirectness: differences in population
Differences in age
Differences in age groups constitute a common
indirectness issue in patients: elderly versus younger
people, or children versus adults. For example,
in a guideline that addressed the management of
pancreatitis in children, authors found very limited
evidence for antibiotic use in this age group. They
therefore conducted a search for evidence from adults,
ultimately using the indirect evidence as the basis
for their recommendation. Although they did not
conduct a formal certainty rating, authors described
the evidence as limited, acknowledging decreased
certainty associated with indirectness.17
Changes over time
Target patients may differ in many ways from patients
enrolled in research studies. For example, the
characteristics of the presenting patients may evolve
over time, as occurred during the covid-19 pandemic.
Casirivimab and imdevimab given in combination and
sotrovimab given alone are monoclonal antibodies that
bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, thus neutralising
the virus. Randomised controlled trials conducted
in 2020 and 2021 showed that both casirivimab and
imdevimab combined and sotrovimab alone reduced
mortality in patients infected with the circulating virus
at that time, motivating World Health Organization
recommendations for use of these agents.
However, changes in the sequence of the virus spike
protein that occurred when omicron or its subsequent
sublineages became the dominant variants resulted
in substantially diminished neutralisation activity
in vitro.18 The population in the target PICO had

make inferences about their target PICO. The extent to
which relative effects will differ across such variables
becomes a matter of mechanistic reasoning based
on indirect evidence from basic research or other
possibly analogous conditions, rather than on direct
evidence from the patients and interventions under
consideration. This method is thus less secure.

CORE GRADE: INDIRECTNESS

Differences in condition
On occasion, when direct evidence is unavailable or
of low or very low certainty, systematic review authors
can look to populations with some similarity but
nevertheless considerable differences from the target
population. For instance, a review team addressed the
choice of mechanical or bioprosthetic valves in patients
with dialysis dependent end stage kidney disease
who required surgery for valvular heart disease.21
Patients receiving mechanical valves require long term
anticoagulation whereas those receiving bioprosthetic
valves do not. Observational studies comparing the two
valve types provided only very low certainty evidence
for one of the authors’ key outcomes—postoperative
and non-gastrointestinal bleeding at latest follow-up.
Given the very low certainty evidence, the authors
sought indirect evidence and conducted a systematic
review and meta-analysis of five randomised controlled
trials of warfarin versus placebo in other populations.
They found an incidence rate ratio for bleeding of 2.99
(95% confidence interval (CI) 1.46 to 6.13) which, after
rating down for indirectness of the population, they
considered moderate certainty evidence of increased
bleeding with the mechanical heart valves.

Indirect evidence for harms

In rare conditions, randomised controlled trials are
typically small or very small. Estimates of intervention
harms may therefore yield very wide CIs warranting
rating down twice for imprecision.
The interventions in such situations may have been
repurposed after use in much larger populations with
other conditions. Although it would be unwise to
assume similar benefits across these conditions and
the new indication, one might expect the adverse
effects associated with a drug to be similar irrespective
of the illness for which it is administered.
One might therefore rate down for indirectness only
once—or not at all—for harms. Accordingly, if one had
high certainty evidence for harms in other conditions,
one would have moderate or high certainty for the
4

population of immediate interest. Core GRADE users
have applied these principles. Examples include the
use of steroids in other inflammatory conditions to
its use in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura22
and chronic urticaria,23 and allergen immunotherapy
in asthma and allergic rhinitis to its use in atopic
dermatitis.24
Systematic review authors have also applied the
same principle to related conditions to improve the
precision (ie, narrow CIs) of the estimates of harms
across each of these conditions. For instance, a
systematic review team pooled data from trials of
corticosteroid use in sepsis, acute respiratory distress
syndrome, and community acquired pneumonia to
generate precise estimates of adverse effects.25

Examples of indirectness: differences in interventions
Interventions studied may differ from the target
PICO in several ways, including dose of a drug
(higher or lower than the target intervention),
duration of administration (shorter or longer), route
of administration (parenteral versus oral), or the
skill level of providers of interventions such as in
educational, surgical, physiotherapy, and psychosocial
interventions. Another concerning common source
of indirectness for such interventions is that authors
may not sufficiently describe the components of
the interventions and this failure can preclude their
replication. For instance, the details for cardiac
rehabilitation were so poorly reported in the literature
that surveys of rehabilitation programmes showed
that what they implemented in practice differed
substantially from what randomised controlled trials
had shown to be effective.26 Inadequate description of
the intervention constitutes a reason for rating down
for indirectness.
Non-adherence
Another common way that trials of interventions
differ from the target interventions is nonadherence of patients. Generally, patients and their
healthcare providers are interested in the impact
of an intervention when used as intended. High
levels of non-adherence introduce problematic
indirectness and thus compromise the certainty of
the evidence.
For example, a randomised controlled trial of
nortriptyline as an adjunct to nicotine replacement for
smoking cessation randomised 901 adults attending
a smoking cessation service to nortriptyline or
placebo.27 They found that one year after quit day, 11%
in the nortriptyline group versus 9% in the control
group (relative risk 1.26, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.87) had
stopped smoking. However, much earlier, four weeks
after quit day, only 59% of patients in the treatment
group and 56% of patients in the control group were
taking the drugs. Had adherence been close to 100%,
the impact of the intervention may have been greater,
the estimate more precise, and the evidence would
warrant higher certainty. The trial thus provides only
indirect evidence of the effect of nortriptyline on

now changed from those infected with the viruses
circulating earlier to those infected with the variants
subsequently circulating. The panel had no direct
evidence—that is, no studies of the antibodies in
the era of the new virus variants were available.
Nevertheless, the laboratory evidence of diminished
antibody neutralisation led the panel to conclude
that the original randomised controlled trials now
provided only very indirect evidence for the key
outcomes, the antibodies were very unlikely to be
effective in the new target population, and strong
recommendations against use of the antibodies were
warranted.19
Similar challenges arise when, in searches for direct
evidence, Core GRADE users must rely on results
from older studies when diagnostic criteria and the
availability of treatments differed. Relapsing and
remitting multiple sclerosis provides an example of
this phenomenon.20

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING

Finally, it is possible that randomised trials in which
patients achieved high adherence may provide indirect
evidence from a public health or funder’s point of
view. Studies of behavioural interventions that most
patients find extremely challenging to follow may
enroll particularly committed patients and implement
adherence enhancing strategies that are unfeasible
or not widely applicable. They may thus achieve
adherence that is unrealistically high for clinical
practice.30 31 From a public health point of view,
putting resources into such interventions for typical
patients who cannot achieve high levels of adherence
may be a poor decision. The high adherence situation
thus represents, from the policy makers’ perspective,
problematic indirect evidence.

Trials that allow switching treatments
Oncology trials may have protocols that allow
switching treatments when a patient does not respond
to the original intervention. For instance, consider the
relative effects of two anticancer drugs, interferonalfa and sunitinib, in adults with renal cancer.
Systematic review authors encountered trials in which
participants who experienced disease progression
after treatment with interferon-alfa received sunitinib
and other related treatments.32 How might this design
bear on issues of indirectness?
The answer lies in considering the target PICO.33
Core GRADE users whose target PICO designates
the comparison of sunitinib alone to interferon-alfa
including the proviso that patients who do not respond
to the drug are offered sunitinib will find results directly
applicable. Systematic review authors interested in the
impact of the two drugs without such switching will, in
contrast, face limitations in the directness of the results.
In the latter case in which users are interested
in the independent effect of the drugs, the extent
of indirectness will depend on the proportion of
participants in the intervention arm who switched
to the alternative intervention. If the proportion of
patients who switched is large, the indirectness may
be considerable and warrant rating down. If few
patients switched, indirectness may be minimal and
not warrant rating down.
A second determinant of the necessity to rate down
would be the apparent effect of the interventions.
Considering the example comparison, if substantial
switching to sunitinib occurs and the result for the arm
that began with interferon-alfa proves similar to that of
the sunitinib arm, the issue is in doubt: is the “rescue”
sunitinib responsible for the similar results, or would
the results have been achieved with interferon-alfa
alone? On the other hand, if sunitinib proves superior,
that superiority would only have been greater had no
switching occurred. In the relevant systematic review,
sunitinib and other related target treatments proved
superior to interferon-alfa (relative survival 1.3, 95%
CI 1.1 to 1.5). Thus, indirectness does not compromise
the conclusion about sunitinib’s superiority to
interferon-alfa, and authors have no need to rate down
for indirectness.

smoking cessation in those who use the intervention.28
In a systematic review that included additional trials
that also had concerns about adherence, the CI was
narrower (relative risk 1.29, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.72)
suggesting that nortriptyline may increase smoking
cessation (low certainty evidence due to indirectness
and imprecision).29
Indeed, the indirectness here is serious enough that,
if the target PICO specified the effects of the intervention
when people use it, the extent of non-adherence would
surely warrant rating down for indirectness. Even
though adherence was very limited, results suggested
a possible signal in favour of nortriptyline. It is entirely
plausible that had adherence been very high the
results would have shown a benefit of nortriptyline in
improving quit rates in smokers.
Note that if the intervention of the target PICO
included how nortriptyline was actually used in
the community, one might conclude that the low
adherence study provided direct evidence. Such
targets that include considerations at the population
or public health level occur particularly often in health
technology assessments.
In trials of screening interventions, when the target
PICO may well focus on those who are adherent,
indirectness due to those who are not adherent is
often a major problem. Consider a randomised trial of
colonoscopy screening for colorectal cancer versus no
such screening, and a PICO of interest that specifies that
patients all undergo the screening intervention. The
question of interest to patients would be: “What will
be the impact if I undergo screening?”—and contrasts
with the question of interest to the policy maker:
“What will be the effect of instituting a programme
in which only some of the eligible population will be
interested?”
A randomised controlled trial of colonoscopy
allocated more than 84 000 participants in Norway
(highest participation >60%), Poland (lowest
participation 33%), and Sweden to receive or not
receive an invitation for colorectal screening. In the
intention-to-screen analysis, the intervention reduced
the relative risk of developing colorectal cancer by
18% (95% CI 7% to 30%). The absolute risk reduction
was about 2 in 1000 population over 10 years—a
magnitude of effect some might consider not worth
the burden of screening. The evidence is, however,
indirect: the investigators would presumably have seen
a larger effect if all those invited had participated.
Indeed, a per protocol analysis focusing on the
Norwegian population estimated that, if adherent,
patients would experience a 45% relative risk
reduction. With this estimate, the effect is still small
but appreciably greater, about 6 per 1000 population.
The per protocol analysis provides a more direct
estimate but with increased risk of bias. In general, the
greater the differences between the anticipated effect
in a fully adherent population compared with the effect
observed in the partially adherent population studied,
the more likely Core GRADE users will rate down for
indirectness.

CORE GRADE: INDIRECTNESS

Examples of indirectness: differences in comparators
Situations in which the comparator differs from that
in the target PICO include variations in standard care
between jurisdictions, use of placebo when an active
treatment is the clinically relevant active comparator,
inferior older alternatives rather than current optimal
alternatives, and differences in dose or route of
administration.37 These problems may arise in searches
for direct evidence when systematic review authors do
not explicitly identify their comparator.
The problematic use of placebos rather than active
comparators is common,38 particularly in drug
development trials that have the ultimate goal of
obtaining regulatory approval. For example, many
randomised trials of disease modifying biologics for
patients with rheumatoid arthritis did not use active
comparators,39 including trials enrolling patients
with a high level of active disease, thus withholding
potentially helpful treatments. While meeting
regulatory requirements, such designs, by choosing
suboptimal comparators, raise issues of indirectness.
The use of suboptimal comparators in industry
sponsored trials is common, and include the following
examples. Large industry sponsored trials evaluating
newer antihypertensive drugs chose the beta
blocker atenolol as the comparator, despite previous
evidence showing inferiority of beta blockers to a
low dose thiazide diuretic.40 Manufacturers of newer
antipsychotic agents overestimated the advantages
of reduced toxicity of their drugs by comparing them
to inappropriately large doses of older alternatives.41
Eight such trials used fixed doses of haloperidol 20 mg/
day, substantially above recommended doses.42 Several
studies used interferon beta-1a given intramuscularly
as the comparator versus new drugs for multiple
sclerosis after investigators had established the
superiority of subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b.43-46
A more recent example comes from randomised
controlled trials in patients with multiple myeloma
conducted in the US in which enrolment occurred
between 2010 and 2020.47 The authors considered
a control group regimen inferior if, before patient
6

enrolment began, a previous randomised controlled
trial had shown an improved progression-free survival
versus the control group. Of 49 identified randomised
controlled trials, seven (14%) began enrolling patients
into inferior control groups after a study of an existing
superior regimen had been published. The primary
funding source in all seven was the pharmaceutical
industry. These trials provide only indirect evidence for
what might happen had trial investigators chosen the
best available comparator. In 2000, a similar analysis
of multiple myeloma trials illustrated the persistence
of problems related to the selection of an inferior
comparator.48
Chinese investigators studying randomised trials of
anticancer drugs authorised by Chinese institutional
review boards between 2016 and 2021 reported a
similar problem. They found that 60 (13.2%) of 453
phase 2/3 and phase 3 randomised controlled trials
included a suboptimal control arm.49 In all these
situations Core GRADE users would rate down the
certainty of evidence for indirectness against the
appropriate optimal comparator.
Investigators may sometimes have no choice
but to use placebo comparisons to obtain indirect
estimates of effects of alternative active agents.
For instance, systematic review authors informing
a clinical practice guideline were interested in
interventions for the management of patients with
X linked hypophosphataemia.50 In particular, they
wanted to evaluate the impact of burosumab on pain
and function, both against no specific treatment and
against conventional treatment of phosphate salts and
active vitamin D. The authors identified a randomised
controlled trial of burosumab versus placebo that
provided moderate to high certainty evidence for some
of the key outcomes, but no study comparing the drug
with standard of care. They offered evidence from the
trial against placebo as the best estimates representing
the maximum differences against standard of care,
rating down once for indirectness for each outcome.
Although not a satisfactory situation, the authors
approach is the best possible under the circumstances.

Differences in outcomes
The impact of intervention versus comparators on
outcomes may differ as a result of how the outcomes
are measured (eg, symptomatic versus asymptomatic
vertebral fracture or symptomatic versus asymptomatic
deep vein thrombosis), or the duration of follow-up
(short term versus long term). Outcomes may also
differ by how they are measured: directly (death rates)
or indirectly through surrogate measures (reduction
in viral load in HIV). Such issues will arise when
Core GRADE users include studies that measure only
surrogates and not patient important outcomes.
How should Core GRADE users handle the situation
when the available outcome is a surrogate or substitute
for what patients consider important? Core GRADE
users will specify the patient important outcome for
which the surrogate is substituting and consider the
degree of indirectness, inferring the impact on the

Change of intervention technology
When the intervention is a device or technology, its
evolution over time can result in important indirectness
that lowers certainty. For example, devices that help
people manage their diabetes are constantly changing.
Continuous glucose monitoring systems were
approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the
late 1990s and have quickly evolved with new sensor
technology such that wear time has lengthened from a
few days to weeks and months. “Real-time” systems,
systems managed with smart phones, and systems
linked to insulin delivery pumps (closed loop systems)
are now available. Guidelines on diabetes technology
struggled with indirectness of older evidence and
have continuously balanced two strategies: excluding
studies of obsolete systems versus including studies
of older systems and lowering certainty due to
indirectness.34-36

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING

Table 1 | Summary of findings table addressing long term heart failure symptoms in randomised controlled trials of percutaneous versus surgical mitral
commissurotomy
No of trials/No of patients
Six randomised controlled
trials, 458 patients

Result
Little or no difference in symptoms of heart failure inferred from
difference in mitral valve area of 0.13 cm2 higher (95% CI 0.09 lower
to 0.35 higher) in patients undergoing commissurotomy

patient important outcome from the surrogate and
rating down certainty of evidence as appropriate.
The following example provides an application of the
approach.
Consider patients with mitral valve stenosis faced
with the choice of percutaneous versus surgical mitral
commissurotomy. A key outcome for such patients
is progression of heart failure symptoms as a result
of the procedure failing over the long term. Because
patients with larger valve areas generally have fewer
symptoms, studies comparing these procedures
report the mitral valve area as a measure of success.
A systematic review of randomised trials comparing
the two procedures addressed their relative merits
for minimising development or progression of heart
failure symptoms.51
The review found that no eligible studies measured
patient symptoms over the long term. What investigators
conducting these studies did measure was a surrogate
for symptoms—mitral valve area at 30 months by
echocardiography or cardiac catheterisation. The
systematic review authors specified their outcome
of interest as patient symptoms over the long term
as inferred from the surrogate. Ultimately, they
rated down the certainty of evidence for imprecision
and inconsistency as well as for indirectness of the
outcome, resulting in very low certainty evidence as
shown in an adaptation of their summary of finding
table (table 1).
Although one might consider rating down
more than one level for indirectness for any PICO
element, this possibility is typically more salient for
surrogate outcomes. For instance, in patients with
end stage kidney disease, disturbances in calcium

Certainty of evidence
Very low due to serious indirectness,
serious imprecision, and serious
inconsistency

and phosphate metabolism may result in fragility
fractures and myocardial infarction. Initial evidence
of new therapeutic interventions focused on measures
of calcium/phosphate metabolism, a very indirect
measure of fractures and myocardial infarction, thus
warranting rating down two levels for indirectness.
Bone density for fractures and coronary calcification for
myocardial infarction represent surrogates that may be
better predictors of the impact of treatment on patient
important adverse outcomes and thus may warrant
rating down for indirectness by only one level.51 Thus,
the decision to rate down one or two levels depends
on one’s understanding of the likelihood that change
in the patient important outcome will follow change in
the surrogate.
GRADE users addressing the possible impact that
treatment effects on surrogate outcomes might have on
patient important outcomes might consider exercises
in which they make specific quantitative assumptions
and model likely results.52 Because we see the likely
gain in rigour and in soundness of conclusions as
marginal, we do not see this as part of Core GRADE.
Table 2 summarises issues in rating down for
indirectness, referring back to the examples we have
used and presenting the likelihood of rating down.

Conclusion
Limitations in the extent to which the PICO in the
available studies differs from the target PICO—in
GRADE called indirectness—represent a common
reason for rating down certainty of evidence in the
development of guidelines and health technology
assessments. When direct evidence is unavailable or
of low or very low certainty, Core GRADE users should

consider searching for indirect evidence that may
result in higher certainty evidence. Whenever the PICO
elements in the relevant studies do not completely
correspond with Core GRADE users’ target PICO, they
must consider the likelihood that these differences will
result in important variation in intervention effects,
and if that is likely they should rate down by one
level for indirectness or—particularly with surrogate
outcomes—by two levels.
