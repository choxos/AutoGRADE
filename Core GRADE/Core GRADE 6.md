SUMMARY POINTS
Summary of findings tables present the key results of a systematic review in
a transparent, structured tabular format, including benefits and harms for
outcomes that are important to patients
The tables present both relative and absolute effects, the certainty of evidence
for each outcome, and the reasons for rating up or down
When subgroups show credible effect modification, summary of findings tables
may include separate rows for different subgroups
When presenting results of binary outcomes, absolute effects are typically
derived by applying relative effect estimates to baseline risks from studies
representative of the target population
When studies use different instruments to measure continuous outcomes, Core
GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation)
users can transform data for presentation to the units of a single preferred
instrument
Summary of findings tables should include plain language summaries, making it
easier for patients, clinicians, and other interest groups to interpret the evidence

measure patient reported outcomes.
Facilitating interpretation then requires
providing details about units of
measurement and minimally important
differences.
This is the sixth paper in a series describing Core
GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation), the essentials of
applying GRADE to the conduct and evaluation of
systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines, and
health technology assessments. The first article in
the series presented an overview of the Core GRADE
process for assessing the certainty of evidence and
rating the strength of recommendations for clinical
questions concerning interventions.1 The subsequent
four articles described how to choose the target of
certainty and the domains for rating down and rating
up the certainty of the evidence.2-5 In this article, we
describe how Core GRADE users can, using summary
of findings tables, provide estimates of effects in
relative, absolute, and continuous outcomes and
then summarise the results using structured evidence
summaries.
Summary of findings tables represent a key GRADE
innovation providing an optimal structure to present
benefits and harms that clinicians, patients, and
decision makers require to guide their choices.
Summary of findings tables systematically present
numerical results, including the relative and absolute
effects, that show the impact of alternative interventions
on prioritised patient important outcomes, and the
associated certainty of evidence. In this paper, we first
describe the components of summary of findings tables
and then present considerations for calculating relative
and absolute effects for binary outcomes and issues
related to presentation of continuous outcomes. We
then address problems related to choice of outcomes,
what to do when one is unable to pool data through
meta-analysis, questions informed by more than one
source of evidence, and use of online software for the
production and dissemination of summary of findings
tables.
The information in this article will enable Core
GRADE users to understand the key components in
summary of finding tables, including relative and
absolute effects, the certainty of evidence, plain
language summaries, and reasons for rating certainty

effects for binary outcomes by applying relative risk
estimates to baseline risk; choose the most appropriate
presentation format for pooled effect measures when
individual studies use different instruments to measure
the same continuous outcome; and understand
considerations in using software for creating summary

Components of summary of findings tables
For each outcome of interest, summary of findings
tables summarise the evidence addressing the effects
of interventions versus comparators and the certainty
of that evidence, as well as reasons for rating down or
up (table 1). Each row in the table focuses on a single
outcome presented in the first column. Subsequent
columns present the number of participants, number
and type of studies, relative and absolute effects
presented as risk differences, certainty of evidence,
and a plain language summary describing the effect.
Although the format for presenting summary of
findings tables may differ, the key information they
present should not. Supplementary appendix 1
shows an alternative format we refer to as an evidence
profile.

Assessing the certainty of evidence involves choices
and judgment. Those making the judgments must
communicate their rationale in succinct, explicit,
and transparent footnotes (ie, explanations) with the
summary of findings table. This is one of the strengths
of Core GRADE: although two Core GRADE users may
arrive at different judgments when looking at the same
body of evidence, providing sufficient information for
readers to understand their rationale will clarify the
reasons for disagreement. For instance, they may have
chosen different thresholds for the minimal important
difference (MID), the smallest magnitude of effect that
patients consider important. Understanding these
reasons may allow, in different contexts, adaptation
of existing summary of findings tables to different
choices or judgments. Explanations should be
concise, informative, relevant, easy to understand,
and accurate.7 Supplementary appendix 2 provides
more details and examples of how to write optimal
explanations.
A previous GRADE paper provided guidance for
wording plain language summaries communicating the
effects while conveying the assigned level of certainty
of the evidence, thus facilitating understanding of
evidence summaries.8 Box 1 summarises this guidance

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING

Box 1: Writing standardised GRADE plain language summaries in summary of
findings tables

• High certainty: reduces, increases, or has little to no effect
• Moderate certainty: probably (likely) reduces, increases, or has little to no effect
• Low certainty: may (possibly) reduce, increase, or have little to no effect
• Very low certainty: the evidence is very uncertain; or the effect is very uncertain
When focusing on the target of certainty in relation to the null, plain language
summaries should communicate that there is a benefit or harm, which is to be
understood as a non-null effect. Examples:
• High certainty: knee arthroscopy increases function
• Moderate certainty: knee arthroscopy probably (likely) increases function
• Low certainty: knee arthroscopy may (possibly) increase function
• Very low certainty: the effect of knee arthroscopy on function is very uncertain
When focusing on the minimal important difference, plain language summaries should
communicate that there is an important benefit or harm, or alternatively that there is
little to no important effect. Examples:
• High certainty of an important effect: knee arthroscopy results in an important
increase in function
• Moderate certainty of little to no effect: knee arthroscopy probably has little to no
important effect on function
• Low certainty of an important effect: knee arthroscopy may (possibly) result in an
important increase in function
• Very low certainty: the effect of knee arthroscopy on function is very uncertain

MID thresholds that are the focus of Core GRADE.

Presenting dichotomous outcomes
Presenting relative measures of effect
We have emphasised in both the first and the second
article in this series dealing with establishing the target
of certainty rating and rating down for imprecision1 2
that relative risks are usually similar across different
baseline risks.9-13 Thus, systematic review authors
will usually conduct meta-analyses of relative effects,
using either relative risks, odds ratios, or hazard ratios.
Relative risks are easier to interpret than odds ratios
and facilitate estimation of absolute effects, making
it the preferred measure from a user’s perspective.14
The odds ratio, however, can address problems that
occur with relative risks when baseline risks are high
(>50%).15 Such situations are unusual and relative
risks usually serve well.16
One can interpret hazard ratios, which consider not
only if an event occurs but when it occurs, similarly to
relative risks.17 Investigators often use hazard ratios
when mortality is the outcome of interest and death
rates are high, as in the specialty of oncology (table
1, first and second row). Under these circumstances,
duration of survival becomes the most important factor
for patients.16
Because patients and key stakeholders are primarily
concerned about absolute rather than relative
effects, summary of findings tables include absolute

Calculating and presenting absolute measures of
effect
Applying relative effects to baseline risks
Because they depend on baseline risks, absolute effects
vary from one clinical scenario to another. Therefore,
the first step for Core GRADE users when calculating
absolute effects is to select a specific baseline risk
for the patient group under consideration. In doing
so they should decide on a time frame for measuring
outcomes and in general use that same time frame for
all outcomes.
Use of the same time frame for all outcomes is not an
absolute rule. For example, it is not unusual for benefits
to occur over a short time frame but for rare serious
events to occur only over the long term. A summary of
findings table needs to report both outcomes using the
appropriate time frame.
Because of the often selective sampling process in
many randomised trials, the baseline risk will ideally
come from a rigorous, large observational study that
includes a more generalisable population, a systematic
review of such studies, or a large pragmatic trial
with broad eligibility criteria. Such studies are often
unavailable and as a result systematic review authors
will often use the median event rate in the comparator
arms across all randomised trials included in the
review.16 18
To obtain risk differences, authors apply pooled
relative effects to chosen baseline risks. To illustrate
with an example, consider the outcome mortality as
calculated from randomised controlled trials—row 2 in
table 1. The body of evidence (in this case from a single
randomised trial) suggests that, when comparing
intensive versus less intensive antileukaemic treatment,
the relative risk is 0.83 (a 17% relative risk reduction).
Applying this relative risk reduction to the baseline risk
of death among older adults who receive less intensive
antileukaemic treatment (56%), the absolute risk
reduction with intensive antileukaemic treatment is
calculated as 17% multiplied by 56%, equaling a 9.5%
absolute risk reduction. Supplementary appendix 3
provides more details on how to make this calculation.

Different risk groups

Clinicians can sometimes, considering prognostic
factors for outcomes of interest, identify patients with
sufficiently different baseline risks to warrant different
management strategies. When this is the case, Core
GRADE users may present separate risk differences for
patient groups at varying risk of events, which can lead
to different decisions.
Table 2 presents an example from a systematic review
supporting the development of recommendations

Standardised plain language summaries should convey, for each outcome, information
about the certainty of the evidence and the effect of the intervention. The following
qualifiers then inform the direction of the effect:

measures—risk differences—for key binary outcomes.To
generate risk differences, they apply relative estimates
that come from the meta-analyses to baseline risks. In
making their decisions, they consider the magnitude
and associated certainty of those absolute effects. The
next section presents the method of calculating and
how to present absolute effects.

regarding the use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2
(SGLT-2) inhibitors versus standard care for people
with type 2 diabetes.19 20 The guideline authors,
aware of the large gradients in risk of death in people
with type 2 diabetes depending on their risk factors
and cardiovascular and renal morbidities, made
recommendations taking into account these baseline
risks. The guideline panel identified five risk strata
and ultimately made recommendations specific to
each stratum. Here, we highlight results for the most
important outcome, all cause mortality, from the two
extremes: people at lowest risk and those at highest
risk.
The authors began by conducting a meta-analysis
to calculate the relative effects of SGLT-2 inhibitors on
mortality across the entire population and reported
an odds ratio of 0.77 with a 95% confidence interval
(CI) from 0.71 to 0.83 (table 2). The authors explored
possible subgroup differences in relative effects
across risk groups. They found no evidence of effect
modification, including at the extremes of baseline
risk. They therefore applied the relative risk to the
baseline risks in the two risk groups over a period of
five years (20 per 1000 deaths in people at very low
risk; 265 per 1000 in the highest risk group). The
result was a risk difference of 5 fewer per 1000 with
SGLT-2 inhibitors in the lowest risk group and 48 fewer
per 1000 in the highest risk group. The synthesis team
presented the evidence for all five subgroups in the
summary of findings in adjacent rows—table 2 does so
for the highest and lowest risk groups.
Considering not only mortality but other relevant
outcomes, the panel made a weak recommendation
against treatment in the very low risk group and a
strong recommendation in favour in the very high
risk group. In other situations, particularly when
displaying multiple important outcomes, it may be
appropriate to develop separate summary of findings
tables for each risk group.
Using different risk groups may lead to different
targets of certainty rating, as it did here (target little or
no effect in the low risk group and an important effect
in the high risk group). This may then result in different
decisions about precision and inconsistency. Here,
using an MID in mortality of 10 in 1000, the entire CI
for the low risk group fell in the range of no important
4

effect and in the high risk group fell entirely in the
range of an important effect, in both cases indicating
no serious imprecision.

Directly calculating risk differences

Calculating risk differences by applying relative effects
to baseline risks may, in some scenarios, result in
misleading point estimates of effect and even more
misleading and asymmetrical CIs.21 Such results often
occur when the outcome is rare (event rates <2% and
most problematic <1%). Faced with this problem,
rather than conducting meta-analysis of relative
effects, review authors should generally conduct metaanalyses of risk differences. Supplementary appendix
4 provides examples.

Presenting continuous outcomes
When studies use the same measure
In many cases, studies reporting an outcome measured
as a continuous variable use the same instrument or
scale across studies. Take, for instance, length of
hospital stay (measured in days) in table 1 or pain
(often measured using a 10 cm visual analogue scale)
in table 3.
When studies use the same measure, an intuitive
measure of effect is the mean difference. Because
natural units (that is, the units of the outcome measure,
for instance hospital days, or, in table 3, option 1,
the units of the KOOS (Knee injury and Osteoarthritis
Outcome Score) pain scale rather than statistical units
such as the standardised mean difference) are used,
Core GRADE users present the mean difference in the
absolute effects column. To facilitate interpretation,
the preferred approach is to provide information about
the outcome in the comparison group (for example,
in table 1 the median duration of hospital stay in the
control arm was 24 days), the intervention group (37
days in table 1), and the difference between the two
(13 days).
In addition to describing the time point of interest
and method of measurement of the outcomes (eg, visual
analogue scale, KOOS pain scale, days in hospital), the
summary of findings table should provide, when it is
not obvious, the range and direction of the scale or the
units in which the results are presented. For example,
blood loss may be presented in millilitres or ounces,

*Although the I2 statistic was high, all point estimates suggested little to no effect and therefore no rating down for inconsistency.
†Some pain summaries suggest small but important differences in pain, whereas others suggest only unimportant differences, warranting rating down for inconsistency.

§Baseline risk of 669 per 1000 based on the median of number of people who achieved an improvement of MID or greater in the conservative management groups.
¶Using an MID of 100 per 1000 patients (10%), the 95% CI crosses this threshold, suggesting the possibility of a trivial benefit and thus warranting rating down for inconsistency.
**Using Cohen’s threshold for interpretation of SMD, the 95% CI crosses the MID (small effect threshold) of 0.2, suggesting the possibility of an important benefit and thus warrants rating down
for imprecision.

and visual analogue scales for measuring pain are used
with ranges of 0-10 cm or 0-100 mL—the interpretation
of the same mean difference of 2 points will be very
different if a 10 point scale versus a 100 point scale is
used. Similarly, some patient reported outcomes might
be measured with instruments in which higher scores
signify better outcomes, and others in which lower
scores signify better outcomes (we present an example
in the next section). Core GRADE users should therefore
communicate the direction of the instrument’s scale.
Finally, perhaps the most useful way of ensuring
the interpretability of the outcome is to designate the
smallest difference patients perceive as important, the
MID. For instance, a footnote in table 1 specifies the
MID for reduction in hospital stay of five days and the
first row in table 3 specifies the MID for the KOOS pain
scale of 12.

When studies use different measures
Researchers sometimes measure the same outcome
using different instruments. This most often occurs in
health status measures that address constructs such
as health related quality of life, function, or severity of
symptoms. Multiple instruments are often available,
and investigators make different choices for their
studies. When this occurs, it presents challenges for
systematic review authors.
Table 3 presents an example from a systematic
review assessing the effect of knee arthroscopy versus
conservative management in people with degenerative
knee disease22 developed to support a guideline.23
Across the included randomised trials, researchers
used seven different instruments to measure the
the bmj | BMJ 2025;389:e083866 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-083866

outcome of function related to knee arthritis.24-30
When preparing their summary of findings table, Core
GRADE users have several options for summary effect
measures,31-33 three of which are illustrated in table 3.
A previous GRADE paper provides additional details of
the alternatives,32 and another previous paper details
the statistical methods involved.31

Option 1: Using the mean difference on the scale of
an index instrument

When one of the instruments is more commonly
used and understandable than others (the index
instrument), Core GRADE users can convert the other
scores into the scale of the index instrument. They then
conduct the meta-analysis using the mean difference
on the index instrument as the measure of effect. In the
example, clinical experts suggested KOOS, which uses
a scale of 0-100 (with higher scores representing better
function), as the index instrument.
When studies reported function using the Western
Ontario and McMaster Universities’ arthritis index
domain (range from 0 to 68, with higher scores
representing worse function) transforming to a scale of
0-100 and reversing the direction allowed combining
results across studies using the mean difference
(table 3, first row). When choosing this option,
systematic reviewers are likely to require different
conversions for each instrument (for example, scores
from the Arthritis Impact Measurement Scale, with
a range 0-10, multiplied by 10) or may need no
conversion at all if another instrument uses the same
range (for example, SF-36 survey scores also have a
scale from 0 to 100 in the same direction as KOOS).

Option 2: Presenting data as binary outcomes

If systematic reviewers or guideline developers know
what the MID is for each of the instruments and assume
a normal distribution of results, they can calculate the
proportion of people who experience an improvement
larger than the MID within each arm, thereby obtaining
a risk ratio or risk difference for each of the studies.
They can then pool these proportions across studies.
Alternatively, if an MID for each instrument is not
available, reviewers can convert scores into the scale
of the index instrument with a known MID. Based
on the results of a systematic review of the literature
addressing MIDs across instruments,35 the second
row of table 3 shows the results of such an analysis.
Previous papers describe the underlying statistical
methods.16 31

Option 3: Calculating the standardised mean
difference

When included studies assess the same outcome but
measure it using a variety of different scales review
authors sometimes choose another option, the
standardised mean difference (SMD) as a summary
statistic.36 By dividing the mean difference between
the treatment and control groups by the pooled sample
standard deviation in each study at a specific time
point, the SMD converts the results of all studies to
standard deviation units.37
The SMD is prone to two major problems. Firstly,
SMDs express the size of the treatment effect in each
study relative to the variability observed in that
study. Many may find the resulting treatment effect
reported in standard deviation units rather than the
original units of measurement difficult to interpret.37-39
Secondly, although guidance is available to interpret
SMDs (ie, an SMD of 0.2 is the threshold for a small and
important effect),40 clinicians may be appropriately
sceptical of this threshold, which is limited by large
variability in the methods investigators use to calculate
the SMD.39 41 Lastly, the SMD bears a highly variable
relation to the actual magnitude of effect: in two
studies with exactly the same magnitude of effect,
the SMD will be much larger in a study that enrolls a
homogeneous population than in one that enrolls a
heterogeneous population.41
All these options have limitations. Although the SMD
(option 3) remains the most used summary statistic,
for the reasons we have noted, it is often the least
satisfactory. Review authors should consider using the
SMD only when the outcome is reported using multiple
scales and no instrument measuring the construct
has a credible MID available.42 43 For many clinicians,
using natural units in relation to their MIDs (option 1)
6

remains an unfamiliar approach, and in interpreting
results they must avoid the temptation of inferring
that any effect smaller than the MID is unimportant.
Converting the continuous to a binary outcome (option
2) is appealing in that this is a presentation with which
clinicians are familiar. Other options remain available,
including the ratio of means, a presentation that some
find intuitive and appealing.44
We suggest presenting the mean difference and
interpreting these differences in relation to the MID
(option 1), as well as the binary outcome approach
(option 2).14 If results are concordant between
these approaches, review authors may make strong
inferences about the apparent magnitude of effect.
If not, inferences about magnitude must be weaker.
Indeed, in table 3 the methods that present a
continuous variable (options 1 and 3) suggest a
small and likely unimportant effect, whereas the
binary approach (option 2) provides a point estimate
of 12.4% more individuals who gain an important
improvement, an effect that most patients are likely to
consider important.
Core GRADE users will acknowledge the discrepancy
between interpretations of the results and rate down
certainty of evidence accordingly. They must still,
however, take responsibility for a coherent message
for clinicians and patients who rely on them for
guidance. Given the evidence in table 3, conclusions
of little or no effect or a small but important effect are
both reasonable. Guideline panels will need to come
down on one side or the other and present results in
their summary of findings tables that support their
inference. The text discussion should, however, present
alternative results in explaining the lower certainty of
evidence supporting their ultimate inferences.

Additional considerations for summary of findings
tables
Choosing which outcomes to present
Previous GRADE guidance suggested limiting the
number of outcomes to seven,16 but this may not
adequately serve the needs of the target audiences
of a particular systematic review. For instance,
target audiences may be interested in the effect of
an intervention at different time points; they may
wish to see different ways of presenting the outcome,
such as in the example in table 3, including both as a
dichotomous and as a continuous outcome; they may
wish to see evidence for a single outcome from both
non-randomised studies and randomised trials such
as for the outcome mortality in table 1; if no evidence
is available for a critical or important outcome, Core
GRADE users may consider including a row that
describes this explicitly (eg, outcome quality of life in
row 6 of table 1). For all these reasons, decision makers
or clinician audiences may require tables that have
more than seven rows.
Thus, when creating summary of findings tables,
we suggest being parsimonious but flexible and using
online supplementary material and digital publication
platforms that allow the publication of interactive or

Authors can then make the results on the index
instrument interpretable by relating it to the MID.
In this case, the best estimate of the KOOS MID is
12 units.34 Because the mean difference (5.38) is
much less than the MID, one can conclude that any
improvement as a result of the intervention is small
and likely unimportant.

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING

When data cannot be pooled
While one can, for individual studies, always present
quantitative data that authors report, in some
instances it is not possible to use a meta-analysis to
pool the results across studies. For example, authors
may not have reported the data in a way that allows
review authors to transform the data to accommodate
their analysis, or the reported data may be insufficient.
Such circumstances require a narrative synthesis.
In these situations, Core GRADE users will follow
the same principles in their data synthesis and
presentation as they do when they can generate pooled
estimates: they will provide a summary at the outcome
level and rate the certainty of the evidence. They will
present their narrative summary in the same columns
as the effects of interventions. In the absence of a
pooled estimate, they can still make judgments on the
certainty of the evidence rating using the same GRADE
certainty domains.46
The third row of table 1 provides an example for the
outcome of complete remission, reported in the studies
as median rather than mean. In this case, clinical experts
advised against converting to means and the studies did
not report sufficient data to do a meta-analysis using the
difference in medians as the measure of effect. In this
case, the summary provided the number of studies with
positive and negative results and the range of differences
between intervention and comparator in duration
of illness across studies. The Cochrane Handbook
provides detailed explanations and examples of how to
summarise these types of data.47
Burden of treatment
In addition to displaying benefits and harms in their
summary of findings tables, Core GRADE users may
choose to narratively summarise available data on the
burden of interventions48 49—what has been called the
“work” of being a patient and what GRADE guidelines
have referred to as practical issues. Supplementary
appendix 5 provides more details and examples on
presenting practical issues in summary of findings
tables. This work includes drug frequency and route,
tests, and clinic visits; procedures and devices;
coordination of care; recovery and adaptation;
managing dependencies; directions for how patients
should manage their diet, exercise, and health habits;
adoption and routine use of digital self-management
and clinical communication tools; impact on work and
social life; and any physical or emotional distress that
may come with managing all these issues.50 Having
these data summarised in summary of findings tables
can enable their use in shared decision making with
patients and in the tools that support this practice.51 52
the bmj | BMJ 2025;389:e083866 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-083866

Direct versus indirect evidence
When direct evidence for an important outcome is
limited, indirect evidence may provide the highest
certainty available evidence, and thus inform the
summary of findings table. In a previous article in this
series addressing indirectness we have described how
Core GRADE users might best handle indirect evidence
in summary of findings tables.5
Two common situations often arise. In the first,
authors may need to present syntheses of evidence
from a different but related population. For instance,
evidence regarding harms of an intervention applied
to a rare disease may come from studies of the
intervention in other more common conditions. The
extent of rating down for indirectness would then
depend on the likelihood that adverse effects would be
similar across conditions.
In another common scenario, Core GRADE users may
need to rely on surrogate outcomes to make inferences
about a patient important outcome. As described in the
indirectness article,5 in such instances the summary of
findings table presents inferences about the impact
of treatment on the patient important outcome while
making clear those inferences are based on results
from a surrogate, rating down once or twice for
indirectness.16
When data are available from randomised trials and
non-randomised studies
Non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSI)
can provide relevant information when synthesising
evidence addressing the effects of interventions.
Randomised trials may not be available for one or more
outcomes for many reasons, one being a harm that
occurs infrequently.53
The fourth article in this series provides guidance for
assessing risk of bias in NRSI as well as circumstances
in which one might rate up certainty of evidence.4
Guidance regarding other reasons for rating down,
including imprecision, inconsistency, and indirectness
for randomised trials also applies to NRSI.
When information from both randomised trials and
NRSI exists, Core GRADE users should prioritise the
source with the highest certainty. As is the case for
indirect evidence, when the certainty of the evidence
from randomised trials and non-randomised studies is
similar, presenting both bodies of evidence in adjacent
rows may be desirable (see table 1, mortality).
Software
When creating their structured summaries of evidence,
Core GRADE users may benefit from online software
that allows for structuring the data and customising
the format of the summary of findings tables while
ensuring all key components are included. Such
software also facilitates the calculation of absolute
effects when presenting binary outcomes, and the
creation of plain language summaries. Core GRADE
users should bear in mind, however, that while
available software embeds GRADE guidance, it will
not guide users in making judgments and will not flag

additional summary of findings tables (see section
“Software”). What Core GRADE users should not do
is have rows for outcomes that overlap (eg, all cause
mortality and cardiovascular mortality) because of
the risk of double counting, as occurred in a summary
of findings table that included both overall major
bleeding and gastrointestinal bleeding.45

potentially challenging situations, It may even suggest
judgments that are inaccurate. Examples of potential
inaccuracies include automatically rating up for large
effect, not flagging situations when it is best to analyse
risk differences directly, or when reviewers face close
call decisions in more than one domain that warrant
a gestalt judgment across the entire body of evidence
(a situation described in the first article of this series).1
MAGICapp (www.magicapp.org) and GRADEpro
GDT (www.gradepro.org) are two online platforms
that enable users to create and export summary of
findings tables in their publications, presentations,
and teaching materials. Additional paid features allow
for digital publication of alternative formats, including
interactive formats, multilayered presentations of
information, one page presentations, infographics,
and mobile apps, as well as dynamic updates of the
evidence—for example, within the context of living
systematic reviews and guidelines. Figure 1 shows an
example of a multilayered table, here presented with
an interactive infographic directly linking outcomes
to decision aids that support shared decision making
(https://www.bmj.com/content/370/bmj.m3379).54

Conclusions
Optimal summary of findings tables allow users to best
understand the results of the synthesis and appraisal
of a body of evidence. They are crucial for guideline
panels making recommendations and for health
technology assessment reports. Using summary of
findings tables ensures the explicit and transparent
presentation of all relevant information. Summary
of findings tables can take various forms, but they
8

all share the main features and principles that Core
GRADE users should follow.
