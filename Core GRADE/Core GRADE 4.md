SUMMARY POINTS
To address certainty for risk of bias, Core GRADE users begin by classifying
individual studies as overall low or high risk of bias
If high risk of bias studies dominate, Core GRADE users will in most instances
rate down certainty of evidence for risk of bias
Substantial evidence from low risk of bias studies with important difference
in results from high risk studies mandates using only results from the low risk
studies
Substantial evidence from low risk studies with similar results to high risk
studies mandates using results from all studies and not rating down for risk of
bias
Considering funnel plot asymmetry or statistical approaches and the role of the
pharmaceutical industry, Core GRADE users can assess risk of publication bias
Methodologically rigorous non-randomised studies of interventions suggesting
a large effect or dose-response gradient mandate consideration of rating up
certainty of evidence

certainty of evidence when risk ratios
from pooled estimates suggest large or
very large effects.
This is the fourth paper in a series describing Core
GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation), the essentials of the
GRADE approach to rating certainty of evidence and
grading strength of recommendations in systematic
reviews, clinical practice guidelines, and health
technology assessments. The previous articles
presented an overview of the Core GRADE process
and discussed specific aspects of imprecision and
inconsistency.1 2 3
In Core GRADE’s four category system of high,
moderate, low, and very low certainty evidence,
randomised controlled trials start as high certainty
and non-randomised studies of interventions (NRSI,
synonymous with observational studies) start as
low certainty. This paper discusses how Core GRADE
addresses reasons for rating down the certainty of
evidence for risk of bias, publication bias, and reasons
for rating up certainty in NRSI.
The information in this article will enable Core
GRADE users to understand the definition of risk of
bias, choose appropriate instruments for assessing
risk of bias of individual studies, rate risk of bias
across the body of evidence by considering the relative
contribution of low and high risk of bias studies to the
pooled estimate and the similarities or differences in
their results, understand the causes of and approaches
for detecting publication bias, and make appropriate
judgments about when to rate up the certainty of
evidence from NRSI.

Risk of bias
We define bias as a systematic deviation from the
underlying true effect of an intervention on an outcome
of interest in a given population. Both randomised
controlled trials and NRSI may be subject to limitations
in design or execution that can bias the results. Well
designed studies will institute safeguards that minimise
risk of bias, such as centralised randomisation and
blinding. To the extent studies do not implement these
safeguards, risk of bias increases. If serious limitations
exist among the studies dominating the pooled
estimate of effect, Core GRADE users will typically rate
down the overall certainty of evidence for risk of bias.
Issues of risk of bias, and thus safeguards against
bias, differ between randomised controlled trials and

Core GRADE 4: rating certainty of evidence—risk of bias,
publication bias, and reasons for rating up certainty

CORE GRADE: RISK OF BIAS

Risk of bias in individual studies
Randomised trials
Although many instruments address risk of bias
in parallel group randomised controlled trials,4 a
smaller number were designed for general use rather
than being tailored to a specific clinical area. These
include the Cochrane’s original instrument,5 its
revised instrument (RoB 2),6 the instrument developed
by the Clinical Advances Through Research and
Information Translation (CLARITY) group,7 the Critical
Appraisal Skills Programme checklist,8 the Joanna
Briggs Institute checklist,9 the National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence checklist,10 the Scottish
Intercollegiate Guidelines Network checklist,11 and the
Risk Of Bias instrument for Use in SysTematic reviewsfor Randomised Controlled Trials (ROBUST-RCT)
recently developed by an international collaboration of
methodologists.12 Although each of these instruments
has limitations, the most important is that some
include items that in Core GRADE are classified as
indirectness and imprecision rather than risk of bias,
possibly leading to double counting their impact on
the GRADE assessment of the certainty of evidence.4
Box 1 summarises the risk of bias items that
randomised controlled trial risk of bias instruments
appropriately identify and that Core GRADE users may
want to consider.
Two rigorously developed instruments that address
limitations of their predecessors merit particular
consideration. One, Cochrane’s tool for assessing risk
of bias in randomised trials, RoB 2,6 offers a clear
process for assessing risk of bias in which signalling

questions and algorithms reflect the mechanisms
by which bias arises.6 RoB 2 includes five domains
addressing randomisation, deviations from intended
interventions, missing outcome data, outcome
measurement, and selective outcome reporting. It is
the only formal instrument that explicitly addresses
cluster and crossover randomised controlled trials.
This instrument has, however, limitations of
complexity and difficulty in application.13 Its
sophisticated algorithms and the new terminologies
it introduced may contribute to these limitations.13 14
Studies have reported low interrater reliability of RoB 2
and challenges in implementation that systematic
reviewers sometimes experience.15 16
A recently developed instrument, ROBUST-RCT,12
was inspired by the same motivation as this Core
GRADE series: to achieve maximal simplicity without
sacrificing methodological rigour. Strengths of the new
instrument include preparatory systematic surveys of
existing instruments4 and of meta-epidemiological
studies of risk of bias,17 and extensive pre-testing with
both junior and experienced systematic reviewers.
ROBUST-RCT includes six core items addressing
random sequence generation, allocation concealment,
blinding of participants, blinding of healthcare
providers, blinding of outcome assessors, and missing
outcome data, as well as eight optional items. The
instrument provides two approaches to addressing
missing outcome data. The more sophisticated
approach, summarised in supplementary appendix 1,
involves looking across results from all studies. Those
who want to go beyond beyond Core GRADE may
consider this approach.
Although the items included in ROBUST-RCT have
been widely used in other instruments, experience
with the ROBUST-RCT presentation remains limited.
Developers of ROBUST-RCT will provide updates about
the instrument at https://www.clarityresearch.ca/
robust-rct.
Both RoB 2 and ROBUST-RCT suggest that, in some
cases, failure to ensure methodological safeguards
may not lead to risk of bias (eg, blinding of participants
is irrelevant in a trial enrolling neonates). RoB 2
addresses this issue through the signalling questions
in algorithms. ROBUST-RCT does so by including two
steps for assessing risk of bias: firstly, evaluating
whether a methodological safeguard has been
implemented (eg, whether participants were blinded)
and, secondly, judging risk of bias (eg, whether a lack
of blinding actually increased bias).
ROBUST-RCT is well aligned with Core GRADE
principles of optimising simplicity and ease of use
while maintaining necessary rigour. RoB 2, while less
well aligned, includes features that may appeal to
some, and particularly to those who want to go beyond
Core GRADE. In addition, some Core GRADE users with
previous positive experience using one of the other
instruments may value familiarity and continue with
its use.
Based on the instrument they choose, Core GRADE
users will assess the extent of risk of bias associated

NRSI. We will first deal with randomised controlled
trials and then NRSI. The subsequent discussion will
address how Core GRADE users should look across the
body of evidence to decide whether or not to rate down
for risk of bias.

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING

Risk of bias in non-randomised studies
Because of the ubiquitous possibility of prognostic
imbalance between intervention and control groups
that persists after statistical adjustment (residual
confounding), NRSI as a class of study designs begin
as low certainty evidence. Failure to include design
features within NRSI that minimise bias can result in
further rating down to very low certainty of evidence.

Cohort and case-control studies

When, for a particular outcome, randomised trials do
not exist or yield only low or very low certainty evidence,
Core GRADE users consider using NRSI for assessing
the effects of interventions. NRSI include many study
designs, of which the most common are cohort and
case-control. Cohort studies compare individuals who
have received a treatment with those who have not and
follow them for the development of the outcomes of
interest.18 19 Case-control studies identify individuals
who have and have not experienced an outcome and
then ascertain whether or not they have received the
intervention of interest.19 20 Box 2 presents key risk of
bias issues in NRSI.
A large number of instruments are available for
assessing risk of bias in NRSI.21-23 Core GRADE users
might consider the relatively simple, straightforward,
and
parsimonious
Newcastle-Ottawa
quality
assessment scale24 or modifications of that instrument
for both cohort and case-control studies developed by
the CLARITY group.25 26
ROBINS-I (Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised
Studies-of Interventions) version 127 (and the revised
version 228) represents another option for risk of bias
assessments in NRSI. Using the revised version of
ROBINS-I, reviewers begin by identifying and listing
confounding domains relevant to their study question
and then decide whether to proceed with a risk of
bias assessment by answering signalling questions
aimed at identifying studies at critical risk of bias that
Box 2: Risk of bias in non-randomised studies of
interventions

• Different eligibility criteria or selection of participants
between comparison groups such that prognostic
factors for outcomes of interest are differentially
distributed in intervention and control groups
• Inaccurate measurement of interventions
• Inappropriate measurement of outcome
• Inadequate control of confounders (prognostic
factors for outcomes of interest differentially
distributed in intervention and control groups):
○ Inaccurate measurement of confounders
○ Inadequate adjustment for confounding
• Missing outcome data
• Selective outcome reporting
the bmj | BMJ 2025;389:e083864 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-083864

would not warrant further assessment. Reviewers then
assess bias in seven domains addressing from three
to 11 signalling questions. Algorithms based on item
responses lead to an overall rating for each domain as
either low, moderate, serious, or critical risk of bias.
Core GRADE addresses residual confounding by
starting the rating of NRSI as low certainty. In contrast,
ROBINS-I incorporates the residual confounding into
the risk of bias assessment process. Final certainty
of evidence ratings with the conventional GRADE
approaches and ROBINS-I should align.29
Studies have documented that teams often do not
use ROBINS-I version 1 correctly,30 time to complete
the instrument is problematic and usability is poor,
questions are misunderstood, instructions are
unclear, and overall application is demanding.30-33
These experiences suggest that ROBINS-I may not be
particularly well aligned with Core GRADE principles.
The instrument may nevertheless appeal to GRADE
users open to going beyond Core GRADE.

Case series and single arm trials

Case series or single arm trials that include only
individuals who receive the intervention of interest
and not those who do not represent another type
of non-randomised study design in which the
certainty of evidence rating starts from low. Because
unbiased assessment of intervention effects requires
contemporaneous comparisons of treated with
untreated individuals, comparisons that are lacking
in case series, for such studies one almost always
rates down from low to very low. Thus, although an
instrument for assessing risk of bias of case series
exists,34 such assessment is generally not needed when
Core GRADE users assess effects of interventions.35
Results from single arm trials are often compared with
external controls, typically historical (eg, comparing
survival rates for a new cancer treatment with the
survival reported previously with other treatments).
Such comparisons are analogous to cohort study
designs but do not allow adjusted analysis, and are
thus almost always at high risk of bias.

Case series and single arm trials: harms only in
intervention group, a special case

Interventions for which harmful effects are restricted
to those who receive treatment represent a special
case. For instance, only patients who undergo surgery
can experience surgical complications. This is also
true for other invasive procedures. In these cases, the
event rate in the control population is either zero or
extremely close to zero. Because of this, a well done
single arm study of patients receiving the intervention
will provide high certainty evidence of harms that only
occur in patients receiving the intervention.
For example, a study using a large administrative
database including more than 97 000 individuals who
underwent an outpatient colonoscopy identified all
those who were admitted to hospital with intestinal
bleeding or perforation within 30 days. Because the
spontaneous occurrence of such events in any given 30

with each item for each individual study and
subsequently rate each study as low or high risk of bias

in a study”).

day period in individuals not undergoing colonoscopy
is rare, the study provides an accurate estimate of
major complications. Thus, the study provides, for
colonoscopy adverse events of bleeding (1.64 per
1000) and perforation (0.85 per 1000), the same low
risk of bias estimates as we find in rigorous randomised
controlled trials.36

Deciding on low or high risk of bias in individual
randomised controlled trials or NRSI
The extent of risk of bias in an individual study
represents a continuum from minimal to extremely
serious risk of bias. For simplicity, however, Core
GRADE users can assess the overall risk of bias in
individual studies as low or high. This judgment
requires a threshold differentiating the two categories
and the acknowledgment of close call situations (fig 1).
The arrows in figure 1 are a reminder that risk of bias
may be close to a chosen threshold and that close call
situations may bear on subsequent decisions.
For example, consider the outcome of all cause
mortality in a randomised controlled trial not using
blinding and in which randomisation is concealed,
follow-up is complete, and there are no other concerns
about risk of bias. The only important source of bias,
co-interventions, arises from the lack of blinding of
healthcare providers. Core GRADE users must then
consider the likelihood of an important co-intervention
that may be highly impactful in one context (eg, a heart
failure trial with many potent treatments that may be
differentially administered to intervention and control
groups) versus low in another context (eg, multiple
sclerosis, where few potent co-interventions exist and
none have shown an impact on mortality). In the first
context for the mortality outcome, Core GRADE users
would be likely to rate down for risk of bias due to lack
of blinding, and, in the second, they would be unlikely
to do so. One might consider these and other similar
situations as close call decisions about rating down
randomised controlled trials for risk of bias.
Moreover, there is no definitive way to establish
what the threshold should be for the number of high
risk of bias items that merit rating a study as overall
high risk of bias. This might be done for only one high
risk category or item or require two or even more high
risk categories or items to classify a study as high risk
of bias. Thus, review teams may—and indeed do—use
different thresholds.
For example, in a systematic review of randomised
controlled trials addressing the effect of gastrointestinal
bleeding prophylaxis with proton pump inhibitors
among critically ill patients, the authors used ROBUSTRCT to assess risk of bias.37 Regarding the threshold of
4

overall risk of bias in individual trials, if at least one
item was rated as high risk of bias, authors considered
the trial as overall high risk of bias. In contrast, the
systematic review of cohort studies examining the
impact of red and processed meat consumption on
cardiometabolic outcomes38 used CLARITY’s modified
instrument to rate risk of bias in the included cohort
studies and required two or more of the seven items
(authors omitted one irrelevant item) rated as high
risk of bias to consider the overall risk of bias as
high. Finally, in another systematic review evaluating
the effect of using an antipsychotic drug on fracture
risk,39 for the included cohort studies the authors used
CLARITY’s modified instrument to rate their risk of bias
and considered a study at overall high risk of bias only
if three or more of the eight items were assessed as high
risk of bias.
The choice of threshold—high risk of bias in only
one or more than one item or category—may be an
issue that will be impossible to resolve: how often does
risk of bias actually result in bias? We do not know the
answer and are unlikely ever to know. Moreover, the
answer is likely to be context specific. Rating down
a study for a single item or for two items assessed as
high risk of bias would be reasonable; any more would
be questionable. Explicit statement of the threshold
choice, as well as the rationale, increases transparency.

Risk of bias may differ across outcomes in a study
Different outcomes from the same study may be at
different risk of bias. For instance, risk of bias due to
missing outcome data may be higher for an outcome
that is difficult to follow for a long period (eg, quality
of life) than for an outcome that is easy to follow
(eg, survival). The same is true for risk of bias due to
not blinding of outcome assessors: the impact of not
blinding on risk of bias may differ across subjective
(higher risk) versus objective (lower risk) outcomes.17
Blinding of outcome assessors is particularly irrelevant
for all cause mortality—for instance, authors of
one systematic review noted, “Most of the included
trials did not blind the outcome assessors; however,
mortality can be ascertained without risk of bias.”40
A systematic review evaluating the effect of red
and processed meat intake on cardiometabolic and
cancer outcomes provides an example of different
risk of bias judgments across outcomes in a single
study.41 Considering that risk of bias may differ for
all cause mortality, cardiometabolic outcomes, and
cancer, authors assessed risk of bias separately for
each outcome for each included cohort study. Because
prognostic factors differed across outcomes, the
authors concluded that the risk of bias also differed.

In most systematic reviews, however, authors
typically report a figure or table with risk of bias
assessments for each study without distinguishing
between outcomes. Although one might infer that in
such instances authors considered the extent of risk
of bias to be similar for each outcome, they may have
failed to consider the possibility of different risk of
bias across outcomes. Thus, an explicit statement from
Core GRADE users that they did consider the issue and
either concluded risk similar for all outcomes, or report
separately for different outcomes, would be ideal.

Rating risk of bias across bodies of evidence
The ultimate goal of assessing risk of bias in individual
studies is to inform whether to rate down the certainty
of evidence across the entire body of evidence. In
addressing risk of bias across all studies, Core GRADE
users should follow the steps summarised in figure 2.
The flow chart applies to both randomised controlled
trials that will start as overall high certainty evidence
and NRSI that will start as low certainty evidence. For
NRSI, the rating down for risk of bias refers to moving
from low to very low certainty evidence.
Firstly, systematic reviewers need to determine
if high risk of bias studies dominate the body of
evidence—that is, they carry substantially more weight
than low risk of bias studies. If that is the case, Core
GRADE users should pool results from all studies and
rate down the certainty of evidence for risk of bias.
Before doing so they should consider the possible
direction of bias which, as we describe in the next
section “Considering direction of bias,” may obviate
the need for rating down. We would conclude that
high risk of bias studies dominate considering possible
the bmj | BMJ 2025;389:e083864 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-083864

thresholds of weight in the meta-analysis of >65% or
≥55% of the weight.
For example, a systematic review compared the
addition of azithromycin to scaling and root planing
versus not adding azithromycin in patients with
chronic periodontitis.42 For bleeding on probing within
three months, of the four relevant trials the only low
risk of bias trial enrolled only 28 patients and reported
a mean difference in proportion of sites that bled of
5.43. The 95% confidence interval (CI) was very wide
(−8.96 to 19.82), including substantial benefit but also
large harm and the study carried 15% of the weight in
the analysis. The authors therefore included both the
single low and the three high risk of bias trials that
carried 85% of the weight and calculated a pooled
estimate of −6.65 (95% CI −10.41 to −2.89), indicating
benefit of azithromycin. Because of the dominant
evience from the high risk of bias studies and the
corresponding sparse evidence from the single low
risk of bias trial, after considering direction of bias the
authors appropriately rated certainty down for risk of
bias.
Another example comes from a systematic review
comparing child feeding interventions with no
intervention in children aged 5 years and younger.43
The meta-analysis of 15 trials with 1976 participants
suggested increased vegetable consumption in the
child feeding intervention group (standardised mean
difference 0.44, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.65). Reviewers rated
10 trials with 1469 participants and 69% of the weight
at high risk of bias. Thus, after considering direction
of bias, the authors used the pooled estimate to make
inferences and rated the certainty of evidence down for
risk of bias.

Check direction of bias

CORE GRADE: RISK OF BIAS

6

Considering direction of bias
Core GRADE users should also consider the expected
direction of any bias influencing results. If, in studies
showing no important difference in effect, bias would
have increased differences between groups, one can
infer that the actual difference must be, if different
at all, smaller than it appreared. Consideration of
risk of bias would thus reinforce the conclusion of no
difference between groups and consequently there
would be no reason to rate down for risk of bias.
Similarly, if effects in studies show a difference but bias
would have decreased that difference, the inference
would be that the true relative effect is if anything
larger than that observed. There would therefore be no
reason to rate down for risk of bias.
Consider for instance a meta-analysis of randomised
controlled trials addressing the prevention of
Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission that
compared the addition of primaquine to a previous
regimen versus not adding the drug.46 Results
provided evidence that primaquine reduced, rather
than increased, adverse events (odds ratio 0.79, 95%
CI 0.63 to 1.42). Lack of blinding suggested classifying
the studies at high risk of bias. However, if clinicians
know that a patient is receiving an additional drug,
they would be more inclined to attribute symptoms to
side effects from the drug than in patients not receiving
the drug. If they were blinded, there could be no such
differential attribution. Thus, bias from failure to blind
would have led to an overestimation of adverse events
with primaquine. Considering this, the direction of bias
increases our strength of inference that primaquine
does not importantly increase adverse effects. Thus,
review authors appropriately decided against rating
down for risk of bias.
Publication bias
Publication bias refers to the bias in the pooled
estimate of effect that results from failure to publish
studies based on their results—typically studies with
negative findings.47 Analyses of trials registered with
institutional review boards have shown selective nonpublication of studies with negative or statistically
non-significant results.48 49 The effect has proved
greater in NRSI than randomised trials.50 51
At least three causes are associated with selective
non-publication of studies with negative results.
Firstly, authors may fail to submit studies for
publication because of a perception that journals will
consider negative results uninteresting. Secondly,
journal editors and their peer reviewers may indeed
find negative results uninteresting and reject
manuscripts on that basis. Thirdly, for commercially
funded studies, it is in the interest of funders motivated
to maximise use of their product to suppress negative
results and thus create an impression of larger than
actual beneficial effects.
Commercial funding
In one example of selective publication by manu­
facturers, a systematic review examining the effect

In contrast, when appreciable evidence from low
risk of bias studies exists, with reasonable thresholds
for appreciable being ≥35 to ≥45% of the weight in the
pooled analysis, Core GRADE users should consider,
for each outcome of interest, whether low and high
risk of bias studies suggest similar or substantially
different magnitudes of effect. This inquiry should, if
point estimates differ appreciably, include formal tests
of subgroup differences between trials, acknowledging
that such tests are often underpowered when there are
only few trials.
If low and high risk of bias studies suggest
substantially different intervention effects, Core
GRADE users will base inferences on only the low risk
of bias studies as their best estimate of effect and not
rate the certainty down for risk of bias.
For example, a systematic review investigating
the effect of corticosteroid treatment for patients
admitted to hospital with community acquired
pneumonia addressed the outcome of duration of stay
in hospital.44 The investigators judged three trials with
1288 patients at low risk of bias and six trials with 359
patients at high risk of bias (low risk of bias studies
carried 69% of the weight). The authors conducted
subgroup analysis based on risk of bias and found very
different estimates from low risk of bias trials (mean
difference −1.00 day, 95% CI −1.79 to −0.21) and high
risk of bias studies (mean difference −4.41 days, 95%
CI −7.65 to −1.17); (P=0.045 for interaction). Thus,
the authors based their inferences only on low risk
of bias trials and did not rate down certainty for risk
of bias.
If results are not importantly different in low and
high risk of bias studies, Core GRADE users will
include all studies in generating their best estimate
of intervention effects and not rate the certainty down
for risk of bias. The reason: risk of bias is just that—a
risk that in a particular instance may or may not
actually create bias. Investigators may fail to conceal
randomisation, fail to blind, or lose large numbers
of patients to follow-up and still generate minimally
biased results. Thus, if low and high risk of bias
studies suggest similar results, one can reasonably
infer that the high risk of bias studies have provided
minimally biased estimates, use results from all
studies, and not rated down the certainty of evidence
for risk of bias.
For example, a systematic review of randomised
controlled trials compared the effect of human or
bovine colostrum with placebo in preterm infants.45
For the outcome time to reach full feed, four studies
with 131 participants proved at low risk of bias and
two studies with 154 participants proved at high risk.
Low and high risk of bias studies suggested similar
results (low risk of bias studies carried 54% of weight:
weighted mean difference −4.19 days, 95% CI −9.40 to
1.03; high risk of bias studies carried 46% of weight:
−3.47 days, −9.06 to 2.13); (P=0.85 for interaction).
Thus, reviewers used the results from all studies as the
best effect estimate (−3.55 days, −6.77 to −0.33) and
did not rate down certainty of evidence for risk of bias.

studies. Because of the concern about the impact
of industry sponsorship on selective publication,
Core GRADE users should consider rating down for
publication bias when the available studies are all
small and industry sponsors have conducted most or
all of the studies. For instance, a systematic review of
flavonoids in patients with haemorrhoids that found
large relative risk reductions in bleeding and pain
identified 11 studies ranging in size from 40 to 234
participants all of which were industry sponsored.55

Avoiding publication bias: comprehensive search
Consideration of publication bias creates a unique
problem for Core GRADE users: one is guessing at the
presence of something that one cannot document.
Systematic reviews with a less than comprehensive
search may not locate studies published in ­
nonindexed or non-English journals, or studies in registries
(eg, clinicalTrials.gov) or regulatory databases (eg, FDA
and European Medicines Agency),56 thus raising the
possibility of conducting searches from these sources.
For example, a systematic review of leukotriene
receptor antagonists for chronic urticaria identified
24 out of 34 relevant randomised controlled trials in
Chinese.57
Nevertheless, the likely low yield precludes the
necessity of such searches in all or even most cases.
Searches may, however, be desirable in some instances,
such as in Chinese databases when conducting a
systematic review of traditional Chinese medicine.
Even a comprehensive search will not, however,
detect studies with a delay to publication, that were
never submitted, or that do not appear in any study
registries.58
Suspecting publication bias: funnel plots and
statistical tests
Core GRADE users can assess risk of publication bias
by visually inspecting the funnel plot—a scatter plot in
which each dot represents a study included in the metaanalysis. The horizontal axis shows the magnitude of
effect estimate of the individual studies (eg, log odds
ratio, mean difference) and the vertical axis shows
precision of the estimate of effect (eg, inverse of
standard error, sample size).59
In a funnel plot, larger studies with more precise
results are displayed at the apex, and because they are
more precise should be closer to the pooled estimate
of effect. Smaller studies with lower precision scatter
more widely at the bottom and should be symmetrically
distributed around the pooled effect estimate. Thus,
distribution of the dots should resemble a symmetrical
inverted funnel (top panel in fig 3).
If the funnel plot is asymmetrical with a missing
quadrant of small studies with negative results,
publication bias represents a plausible explanation
(bottom panel in fig 3). However, other explanations
include small studies being biased in favour of the
intervention, or small studies more faithfully following
the intervention and thus achieving more favourable
results. Given these alternative explanations we

of reboxetine on acute treatment of major depression
retrieved both published trials from databases
and unpublished data from the manufacturer of
reboxetine.52 Results showed that published data
overestimated the benefit of reboxetine by as much as
115% compared with placebo and 23% compared with
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.
In another example, a study investigated 74
antidepressant trials registered by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) and found selective publication
based on results.53 The FDA deemed results from
38 studies as positive, of which 37 were published.
Among the 36 trials with results deemed as negative
or questionable, 22 were not published and 11 were
published as positive.
Another study analysed 400 randomly selected
trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov for their public
disclosure of results.54 Overall, 118 trials (29.5%)
failed to make their results public within four years
of completion. Commercially funded trials (adjusted
hazard ratio 0.49, 95% CI 0.36 to 0.66) were less likely
to be published or were published later.
In all these examples, authors had access to the
results of unpublished studies, established they
provided much less sanguine results, and thus had
definitive evidence of publication bias. Reviewers may
be aware that eligible studies exist, but results may be
unavailable. If that is the case, and the sample size of
those studies is large enough to impact substantially
on overall results, reviewers should rate down for
publication bias.
Reviewers may rate down for publication bias even
when they have not identified specific unpublished

sometimes refer to such asymmetrical funnel plots as
showing small study effects.
Figure 4 presents an example of funnel plot
asymmetry from a systematic review investigating the
effects of probiotics on risk of acute infectious diarrhoea
lasting ≥48 hours.60 Here, several small studies favour
probiotics to a greater extent than the large studies but
only one small study is less favourable than the large
studies. Such a result warrants serious consideration
of rating down for publication bias.
Using funnel plots to test publication bias does,
however, have limitiations. Visual inspection of
asymmetry involves subjectivity that is prone to error.61
Statistical approaches to test the asymmetry of funnel
plots, including Egger’s regression test,62 Begg’s rank
test,63 and a variety of other tests 64-67 are available
but have been criticised for both false negative rates
and false positive rates.47 68 The use of statistical tests
requires a meta-analysis including ≥10 studies, also
preferable for making inferences about funnel plot
asymmetry.69
Because of the limitations of the approaches for
assessing publication bias, Core GRADE users will
often be left with uncertainty. Core GRADE therefore
suggests using the terms undetected (when no evidence
suggests publication bias and they thus do not rate
down certainty, the usual situation) and strongly

Selective outcome reporting
One type of selective outcome reporting occurs when
the results for an outcome of interest in some studies
are unfavourable and consequently the investigators
do not report the results. In such instances, these
studies do not contribute to the meta-analysis for that
outcome. One can suspect selective outcome reporting
when outcomes specified in the study protocol are not
reported in the final publication, or one anticipates
certain outcomes that authors omit in study
publication while they report less critical ones. Since
the funnel plot and test for funnel plot asymmetry can
detect this problem, it is addressed in the publication
bias domain.
Another type of selective outcome reporting can
occur when studies report the results for the outcome
of interest but the reported result is selected from
multiple available effect estimates (eg, multiple time
points, multiple outcome measurement methods, or
multiple analytical approaches) or the the outcome
measurement is inconsistent between the protocol and
the publication report. NRSI, in which pre-registered
protocols are far less likely to prespecify which of
the possible results will be included in the analysis,
require special attention since reporting bias may be
enormous.70 71 This type of selective outcome reporting
should be addressed as risk of bias in individual
studies rather than publication bias.
Rating up certainty of evidence
Although NRSI start out as low certainty evidence, it
is possible to rate up certainty derived from NRSI to
moderate or even high certainty. We will now review
the two situations when Core GRADE users might
rate up certainty: large magnitude of effect and doseresponse gradient.

Dose-response gradient
The term dose-response gradient describes an
observation that incremental increases (or decreases)
of the dose or magnitude of the intervention produce
incremental increases (or decreases) in the effect. For
example, a meta-analysis of salvage radiotherapy
after radical prostatectomy found that each 1 gray
increase in the dose of radiotherapy is associated with
a 2% increase in relapse-free survival.76 This doseresponse gradient increases our certainty that a causal
connection between the intervention and the outcome
exists.
There are, however, risks in rating up for a doseresponse gradient if the putative causal intervention
is not actually causal but is linked to another
intervention or situation that is causal.77 For example,
several case-control studies showed a dose-response
the bmj | BMJ 2025;389:e083864 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-083864

gradient between coffee consumption and pancreatic
cancer.78 79 As it turned out, the actual cause was
not coffee but smoking, which does cause pancreatic
cancer and for which a true dose-response gradient
has been found (the more an individual smokes, the
higher the likelihood of pancreatic cancer).80 81 The
apparent dose-response gradient for coffee was a
result of an association between smoking and coffee
consumption: smokers drank more coffee, and the
more they smoked, the more coffee they drank.82 83 If
Core GRADE users suspect such confounding between
causal and non-causal associations, they will not rate
up certainty for dose-response.77
Supplementary appendix 2 presents an alternative
conceptualisation of the rating up process in which
studies with large or very large effects and/or a credible
dose-response gradient begin at moderate or high
certainty evidence.

Conclusion
Core GRADE users will, in considering risk of bias,
start by assessing individual studies as being at low
or high risk of bias. When considering all studies
together to decide whether to rate down certainty of
evidence for risk of bias, Core GRADE users will first
consider the relative contribution of high and low risk
of bias studies. If high risk of bias studies dominate the
evidence and bias may be responsible for the observed
effect or lack of effect, Core GRADE users will rate down
the certainty of evidence for risk of bias. If appreciable
evidence exists from low risk of bias studies, Core
GRADE users will determine whether low and high risk
of bias studies suggest substantially different effects:
if that proves the case, they will use only the results
from low risk of bias studies and not rate down the
certainty of evidence for risk of bias; if not, they will
use the pooled results from all studies and again not
rate down.
Although all approaches to addressing publication
bias have limitations, considering funnel plots
or statistical approaches for testing funnel plot
asymmetry may be of use. A body of evidence consisting
of relatively small studies funded by industry should
raise suspicion. When magnitude of effect is large or
very large or a credible dose-response gradient exists
and the risk of bias is overall deemed low, one can
consider rating up certainty of evidence from NRSI.

Large magnitude of effect
As we have described, in the Core GRADE approach
NRSI start out as low certainty and may then be rated
down for risk of bias issues particular to NRSI designs.
When NRSI were not rated down from low to very
low (ie, no risk of bias limitations particular to NRSI
designs, and sufficiently precise to exclude values
less extreme than chosen thresholds), Core GRADE
users will consider whether they show large effects. If
they do observe large effects, Core GRADE users will
consider rating up the certainty of evidence using the
following thresholds: relative risk >2.0 or <0.5 (similar
thresholds for odds ratio and hazard ratio), consider
rating up one level; when relative risk is >5.0 or <0.2,
consider rating up two levels.72 The rationale for this
guidance is that modelling studies have shown that
the likelihood of confounders that could explain a
relative risk >2.0 or <0.5 is low and the likelihood of
confounders that could explain a relative risk >5.0 or
<0.2 is very low.73
For example, a systematic review of observational
studies examining the association between infant
sleeping position and sudden infant death syndrome
found an odds ratio of 4.46 (95% CI 2.98 to 6.68) of
sudden infant death syndrome occurring with front
versus back sleeping positions.74 Such an association
would warrant rating up certainty by one level.
Other factors may strengthen the case for rating
up. These include rapidity of onset (eg, insulin for
diabetic ketoacidosis, and adrenaline (epinephrine) to
treat anaphylaxis) and a relentless downhill trajectory
without intervention (eg, hip replacement for severe
hip osteoarthritis).72 75
Finally, there may be situations in which patients
always or almost always did badly before and do
so much better with a new intervention that no
one has thought it worthwhile to conduct a formal
observational study addressing the issue. Examples
include resuscitation after cardiac arrest, insulin in
diabetic ketoacidosis, adrenaline in anaphylactic
shock, dialysis in terminal renal failure, and volume
repletion in patients with evident volume depletion.
