SUMMARY POINTS
Using Core GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development
and Evaluation), high or moderate certainty evidence typically supports
strong recommendations, whereas low or very low certainty evidence leads to
conditional recommendations
Strong recommendations are made when the desirable consequences clearly
outweigh the undesirable; otherwise, recommendations are conditional
Recommendations should reflect what matters most to patients, and should
consider variability in values and preferences
Primary considerations (benefits and harms, certainty of evidence, values and
preferences) guide all recommendations; secondary factors (costs, feasibility,
acceptability, and equity) become relevant from a population perspective
Determining the smallest important benefit in each important outcome ensures
recommendations focus on what is important to patients
Explicit wording, well structured presentation formats, optimised presentation,
and decision aids help clinicians and patients in shared decision making

Moving from evidence to
recommendations begins with
considering evidence regarding
patients’ values and preferences and
choosing the smallest difference in
each outcome that patients perceive as
important (the minimal important
difference). Core GRADE users
construct statements that make clear
the values and preferences underlying
their recommendations. In general,
Core GRADE users make strong
recommendations only when certainty
of evidence is high or moderate. When
evidence certainty is low,
recommendations will be conditional
under all but special circumstances
In this series we have described the Core GRADE
(Grading
of
Recommendations
Assessment,
Development and Evaluation) process for assessing
the certainty of evidence and creating summaries
of evidence that transparently present the effects of
interventions and the certainty of evidence.1-6 This
last article focuses on the process for moving from
evidence to recommendations (most relevant for
developers of clinical practice guidelines) or health
policy decisions (most relevant for health technology
assessment practitioners). In this article we will use
the term recommendations, but the key considerations
also apply to policy decisions.
Standards for trustworthy guidelines are now
globally accepted and underscore the importance of
a systematic and transparent process for moving from
evidence to recommendations.7 Adherence to Core
GRADE principles greatly facilitates panels in meeting
trustworthiness standards.
This article describes how a guideline panel using
the Core GRADE approach decides on the direction and
strength of recommendations and the implications
of different strengths of recommendations for
clinicians—a term we use to include the full range
of health professionals delivering clinical care—
and patients. In the last section of the paper, we

easily access the relevant evidence and make optimal

The information in this article will enable Core
GRADE users to understand the principles of moving
from evidence to recommendations and decisions
within the Core GRADE framework; understand the
importance of specifying an individual patient and
possible secondary population perspective and the
implications for decisions; differentiate between
strong and conditional recommendations and
understand the principles for issuing each type of
recommendation; understand and apply the concept
of minimal important difference (MID) in clarifying
values and preferences; and develop clear, structured,
and actionable recommendations using standardised
GRADE formats.

Core GRADE recommendations
Recommendations made by guideline panels using
Core GRADE are characterised by their direction—for
or against an intervention—and their strength—strong
or conditional (weak), resulting in four possible
categories: strong in favour of an intervention,
conditional in favour of an intervention, conditional
against an intervention, and strong against an
intervention (fig 1). Core GRADE users choose one
category for each recommendation. Sometimes,
2

although potentially unhelpful to the clinician audience
and therefore seldom appropriate, Core GRADE users
may find the desirable and undesirable consequences
of two alternative interventions so closely balanced
that they recommend use of either. A final additional
rarely used category is a recommendation for limiting
an intervention only to the context of research—an
issue we return to in the section “Only in research
setting recommendations.”
Guideline panels make strong recommendations
when they are confident that the desirable
consequences of an intervention (eg, decreased
mortality and morbidity, improved quality of life)
outweigh the undesirable consequences (eg, adverse
effects, burden of treatment). The reverse (undesirable
outweigh desirable consequences) also dictates a
strong recommendation, but against an intervention.
When desirable and undesirable consequences
favour the intervention but the magnitude of the
difference is smaller, or when considerable uncertainty
about their magnitude or importance exists, panels
will make conditional recommendations.
Another useful way of thinking about strong and
conditional recommendations is to consider a large
group of fully informed individuals (that is, they
understand the relevant evidence and the ramifications
of their decisions) and the choices they would make
between an intervention and a comparator. Panels will

make strong recommendations when they believe that
all, or almost all, fully informed people would choose
the recommended course of action. They choose
conditional recommendations when they believe that
most fully informed individuals would choose the
recommended course of action but an appreciable
minority would choose the alternative.8
Typically, individuals differ in the relative importance
they place on benefits, harms, and burdens associated
with interventions. We refer to these differing views
of importance as peoples’ values and preferences.
Conditional recommendations signal to clinicians
that ensuring a decision consistent with patients’
values and preferences will require a process of shared
decision making.8 9 Conditional recommendations may
also reflect population perspectives, such as restricting
antibiotic use to avoid the development of resistance.10

Determinants of direction and strength of
recommendations
To facilitate decisions on the direction and strength
of recommendations, Core GRADE users can refer to
GRADE’s evidence to decision frameworks.11 12 The
frameworks guide users in the key determinants that
shape their recommendations. Table 1 summarises the
primary and secondary issues in Core GRADE evidence
to decision frameworks, and how they influence the
strength and direction of recommendations according
to the perspective the group takes (see the section
“Perspective”).
Organisation of the guideline process
Ideally, a guideline panel will include a mix of topic
or thematic and clinical experts involved in research,
clinicians involved primarily in patient care, patients,
and methodologists. Optimal guideline function often
involves a small steering or oversight group with one or
more methodologists and clinical experts. The steering
group is responsible for establishing the agenda for
each meeting and guiding the panel through the steps
of moving from evidence to recommendations.

The process of moving from evidence to
recommendations
Figure 2 represents the Core GRADE approach for
moving from evidence to recommendations.
Some GRADE users find it beneficial to use an
alternative approach in which they undertake a
separate structured review of each evidence to
decision factor before integrating it to arrive at their
final decisions. Supplementary appendix 1 presents
an example of a structured evidence to decision
framework which, because of its complexity and the
large number of decisions involved in its completion,
represents an option for guideline panels that want to
go beyond Core GRADE.
Perspective
Guidelines can consider two perspectives—that of
the individual patient and that of a population (also
referred to as public health or societal). Core GRADE’s
focus is on the individual patient perspective, but
Core GRADE recommendations can also include the
population perspective as a secondary consideration.
The decision regarding perspective influences
how Core GRADE users approach the evidence to
decision framework. Three factors of the framework—
the magnitude of benefits, harms, and burdens;
the certainty of evidence; and patients’ values and
preferences—are key in moving from evidence to
recommendations, whatever the perspective.13
Other factors—costs, cost effectiveness, feasibility,
acceptability, and equity—while primarily relevant to
the population perspective, may sometimes play a role
in the individual perspective.

critical outcome. This is necessary for two reasons.
Firstly, as described in the second article in this
series, choosing a threshold will make certainty
ratings possible.2 14 To inform recommendations, that
threshold must be the MID (the smallest difference in
effect that patients would consider important) rather
than the null. Thus, decisions on the MID must precede
certainty ratings in the evidence synthesis.
Having decided on the MID for each outcome, Core
GRADE users rate certainty in an important effect if
the point estimate proves greater than the MID and
in an unimportant effect if the point estimate proves
less than the MID. The systematic review team then
rates certainty in relation to the MID threshold for
both imprecision and inconsistency domains, as the
relevant Core GRADE papers describe.2 3
The second reason is that MIDs reflect the relative
importance patients place on different outcomes—
that is, patients’ values and preferences. For instance,
MIDs associated with mortality of 1%, stroke of
2%, myocardial infarction of 3%, and serious
gastrointestinal bleeding of 5% reflect the gradient of
importance across these outcomes. If the MID associated
with mortality is 1%, with stroke is 2%, with myocardial
infarction is 3%, and with serious gastrointestinal
bleeding is 5%, it tells a great deal about the panel’s
4

inferences regarding the gradient of importance
across those outcomes (importance gradient across
mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction, and bleeding,
mortality five times as important as bleeding). These
value and preference judgments facilitate guideline
panels trading off the benefits, harms, and burdens of
alternative management strategies.
As we described in the second article in this series,2
choosing a single specific MID for a particular outcome
may not be required. For instance, consider a treatment
associated with a large mortality benefit of 5%. All
would agree that this represents an important benefit.
Consider further that the boundary of the confidence
interval (CI) representing the smallest plausible effect
is 3%. This too is clearly an important benefit. Thus,
whether the MID for mortality is 2%, 1%, or less than
1%, the CI does not cross the MID threshold and one
will not rate down for imprecision. As a result, one
need not specify a single particular value for the
mortality MID. In many instances, however, either the
point estimate or one boundary of the CI will be in the
vicinity of a possible MID, and choosing a specific value
of the MID is then necessary. Thus, the process Core
GRADE users should follow is to review estimates of
effects and 95% CIs, determine if MIDs are necessary,
and if necessary, establish MIDs.

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING

Evidence that may inform choice of MID

Ideally, for each key outcome, guideline panels would
have available a systematic survey of all studies bearing
on the MID as well as wider issues of values and
preferences. For instance, a BMJ rapid recommendation
guideline panel addressing the management of
patients with shoulder conditions conducted a
systematic survey of MIDs for improvement in patient
reported outcomes related to shoulder conditions15
that informed a recommendation for subacromial
decompression surgery.16
However, for most outcomes in most guidelines,
little or no useful studies of patients’ values and
preferences are available. Use of guideline panels
limited time and resources in low yield searches for
relevant studies on patients’ preferences is unwise.
Core GRADE practice is therefore to consult experts
in the specialty and, if the likelihood of finding
relevant evidence is very low, to forego the search.
We use the same approach for evidence to decision
considerations of acceptability, feasibility, and equity
in which systematic searches may be even less likely to
provide useful information.
In the absence of well done studies ascertaining the
values and preferences of large samples of patients,
or studies addressing MIDs of specific instruments for
measuring health status (patient reported outcome
measures), alternatives to infer MIDs are far from
ideal. In principle, therefore, guideline panels that
fail to identify such studies would launch their own.
As guideline panels’ limited resources and time
frame make full scale value and preferences studies
unfeasible, this is not, however, realistic. An approach
that is less satisfactory but still informative and much
more feasible is conducting a focus group with a small
number of patients. For example, the American College
of Rheumatology does this for all its guidelines, and
the results have proved useful in informing value and
preference decisions for the guideline panels.17 18
The experience of clinicians in conducting shared
decision making can also be informative about
patients’ values and preferences. For example, a
guideline addressed pregnant women at risk of venous
thrombosis who were considering anticoagulation
with warfarin (low burden treatment) or low molecular
weight heparin injections (high burden treatment).
Clinicians with considerable experience with such
patients had found that women almost invariably
chose the injections to avoid the small risk of relatively
minor fetal abnormalities that may be associated
with warfarin.19 This information suggests that the
MID for fetal abnormalities is very small (mothers
will find even a small risk very important) and the
MID for the burden of the heparin injections large
(mothers will consider a substantial burden of little
importance). The approach is unfortunately open to
the bmj | BMJ 2025;389:e083867 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-083867

biased inferences and is far inferior to well conducted
large patient studies of individual patients’ values.
If, however, clinicians are critical in their reflections
on their shared decision making experience, the
information may be helpful.
Failing these options, Core GRADE users may be
able to utilise less structured conversations with their
patients, or, for patient partners, with other patients.
Whatever the source of evidence on patients’ values
and preferences, that evidence requires interpretation
to generate a trustworthy MID estimate.

Choosing MIDs

Trying to arrive at a best estimate of the MID through
unstructured discussions is challenging, at least in
part because most panelists have limited experience
with deciding on MIDs. This problem has led to the
development of a structured survey approach to help
guideline panelists decide on MIDs for their most
important outcomes.20 The approach relies on offering
panelists extremely low and high MIDs, gathering their
associated choices, and then moving in both directions
towards more likely estimates. The candidate MID
is the value at which half the panel believes the
majority of patients would consider the magnitude
of effect unimportant and the other half believes the
majority would consider the magnitude important.
The guideline steering group explains the survey to
panelists, drafts the survey, administers the survey to
the panel, and presents and provides an interpretation
of the results.
Reflecting differences in the values and preference of
their target populations, including the socioeconomic
and cultural environment in which they function,
panelists may choose quite different MIDs for the same
outcome. Explicit reporting of MIDs, and value and
preference statements, allows users to understand
the determinants of recommendations and how they
might change with alternative values and preferences.
Supplementary appendix 2 presents an example of
the panel survey approach to establishing MIDs, and
supplementary appendix 3 summarises our experience
with the approach, including two panels that chose
quite different MIDs for mortality.21
Moving beyond MIDs to other issues in elucidating
panels’ views on patients’ values and preferences, the
survey approach also provides a method to examine
the minimal benefit patients would require, given the
existing harms and burdens, to use an intervention.
A panel used the approach when evaluating the
smallest reduction in end stage renal disease patients
would require to choose plasma exchange given its
6% increase in serious infections.22 Finally, surveys
can present panelists with a summary of the benefits,
harms, and burdens and obtain their views on the
distribution of choices—from all who would choose
to receive to all who would choose to decline—in the
relevant population. A panel conducted such a survey
to help inform the recommendation for sodium-glucose
cotransporter-2 inhibitors in patients at varying risk of
adverse vascular outcomes.23

Given the frequent necessity for choosing a single
specific MID, decision makers face the challenge of
how to choose an appropriate MID. In the next section
of this article we describe the available approaches.

CORE GRADE: EVIDENCE TO DECISION FRAMEWORKS

Box 1: Examples of guideline value and preference statements

Example 1: WHO guideline on clinical management of covid-19
• The WHO guideline on clinical management of covid-1924 includes one
recommendation for awake prone positioning. The evidence indicated a small
reduction in the need for mechanical ventilation with no other important benefits.
The panel considered alternatives based on its judgments about patients’ values
and preferences (see below) and ultimately selected the first option during the
recommendation process.
○ Option 1: “The panel placed a relatively high value on a modest reduction in
invasive mechanical ventilation and a lower value on the discomfort patients
experience using awake prone positioning.”
○ Option 2: “The panel placed a relatively low value on a modest reduction in
invasive mechanical ventilation and a higher value on the discomfort patients
experience using awake prone positioning.”
Example 2: Living WHO guideline on drugs for covid-19
• During the early phase of the covid-19 pandemic, the panel producing WHO rapid
recommendations on drugs for covid-1925 considered the following patients’ values
and preferences when issuing recommendations:
○ “The Guideline Development Group agreed that the following values and
preferences would be representative of those of typical well-informed patients:
○ Most patients would be reluctant to use a treatment for which the evidence left
high uncertainty regarding effects on the outcomes they consider important. This
was particularly so when evidence suggested treatment effects, if they exist, are
small and the possibility of important harm remains.
○ In an alternative situation with larger benefits and less uncertainty regarding both
benefits and harms, more patients would be inclined to choose the treatment.”
WHO=World Health Organization.

6

In the two examples, the values and preferences
selected interacted with benefits and harms and the
certainty of evidence to inform the panel’s decisions.
In the first instance regarding awake prone positioning
for ventilation in seriously ill patients with covid-19,
the point estimate suggested a 1.2% reduction in
mortality, but the CI included a 1.5% increase. The
evidence for hospital length of stay was equally
unconvincing. Results showed moderate certainty
evidence supporting a 4.1% decrease in endotracheal
intubation. The panel was then left to trade off this
relatively small benefit against patient discomfort and
nursing burden. The value and preference judgment
that the small reduction in ventilation carried a higher
value than discomfort and burden determined the
recommendation in favour of awake prone positioning.
However, the panel believed the balance between
desirable and undesirable consequences was a close
one, that an appreciable minority of fully informed
patients (those who poorly tolerate awake prone
positioning) would decline the intervention, and thus
decided on a conditional recommendation.
In the second example, early in the pandemic,
clinicians were considering repurposed drugs or newly
tested agents with only low or very low certainty
evidence of benefit in patients with severe or critical
covid-19. As is often the case when only low certainty
evidence is available, decisions were very highly value
and preference sensitive. The WHO guideline panel
recognised that some patients, given the severity of
their illness, would be ready to try agents with only
scant evidence of benefit. Others would be reluctant
to subject themselves to the adverse effects of such
agents. Aware of these varying values, the panelists
consistently made conditional recommendations.
Their value and preference judgments, captured in
their statement, drove the direction of their conditional
recommendation against several drugs.
When higher certainty evidence becomes available,
the trade-off typically becomes clearer. For instance,
a practice guideline addressing antithrombotic
treatment required trading off thrombotic versus
bleeding outcomes when in many instances high or at
least moderate certainty evidence was available.26
The trade-off may involve both individual patient
and population issues and, when it does, the
secondary issues of cost, feasibility, acceptability,
and equity become important (fig 2). For example, a
guideline related to transfusion thresholds required
consideration of both mortality (the key outcome from
the individual patient pserspective) and conservation
of the blood supply (the key outcome from the
population perspective).27 Considering conservation
of blood supply contributed to the panelists’ decision
to make a strong recommendation in favour of a lower
transfusion threshold.

Constructing the recommendations
The examples above show how those producing
recommendations must first decide on their direction
and subsequently address their strength as strong or

Balancing benefits, harms, and burdens
In the next step in making recommendations, the
guideline steering group and panel review the
summary of findings table and judge the trade-off
between benefits on the one hand and harms and
burdens on the other. This decision will be informed
by the inferred values and preferences of patients that
the panel must make clear through an appropriate
statement. Such value and preference statements
capture the key considerations in trading off desirable
and undesirable consequences of the intervention and
comparator. This statement will be highly contextual.
For instance, when only low certainty evidence is
available—as was the case early in the covid-19
pandemic—the trade-off requires statements of the
relative value of uncertain benefit versus, usually,
more certain harms and burdens.
Guideline panelists may have limited experience
in constructing value and preference statements, and
the panel steering group, guided by the participating
methodologists, can present them with a suggestion.
Box 1 provides examples of guideline value and
preference statements from several organisations,
including the World Health Organization (WHO)
covid-19 guidelines and a BMJ Rapid recommendation.
As presented in the first example, we have found it
valuable to present options of opposite values and
preferences from which the panel can choose—the
choice will likely determine the direction of the
recommendation.

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING

Only in research setting recommendations
Panels may sometimes make recommendations
for use of an intervention only in research. Such
a recommendation would be an alternative when
panels consider the generation of higher evidence an
important priority. For example, early in the covid-19
pandemic WHO recommended use of ivermectin in
research settings only.29

users will solely or primarily consider the patient
perspective. The panelists in these situations focus
evidence to decision considerations on benefit,
harm, burden, evidence certainty, and values and
preferences, and they only briefly consider cost,
feasibility, acceptability and equity—long enough to
confirm that such factors will not have a substantial
influence on the recommendations.
For example, WHO’s living guidelines for the
treatment of people with covid-19 considered a
recommendation of corticosteroids for those with
severe or critical disease.30 The relevant systematic
review reported a probable 3.4% absolute reduction
in mortality—an order of magnitude far greater than
WHO’s MID of 3 per 1000—as well as substantial
reduction in need for mechanical ventilation.
Moreover, the review reported convincing adverse
effects only in the relatively unimportant outcomes of
hyperglycaemia and hypernatraemia. Given the low
cost and wide availability of the intervention, the panel
judged secondary evidence to decision considerations
of little relevance. Reasoning that all or almost all
people with severe or critical covid-19 would choose
to receive corticosteroids, the panel issued a strong
recommendation in favour of these drugs.
In another example, two allergy organisations
addressed whether topical treatments for uncontrolled
atopic dermatitis should be applied once or twice
daily.31 The network meta-analysis that informed the
recommendations showed a small improvement with
twice versus once daily application (risk difference
of 5% for improved eczema compared with the MID
threshold of 3%32) and similar small improvements
in itch, quality of life, and sleep disturbance. Harms
proved no different between groups, with burdens
anticipated to be lower in the once daily group. To
decide whether patients would consider the small
benefits worth the burden of a second application,
the panel conducted a systematic review of patients’
values and preferences and discovered that they place
a high value on minimising the burden associated with
application of topical treatments. This led the panel
to make a conditional recommendation for once daily
application. Given the modest cost considerations, the
absence of feasibility issues, and the lack of impact
on equity from the individual patient perspective,
only primary considerations proved relevant to the
recommendation.

Population perspective and secondary evidence to
decision considerations
When guideline panels take a population perspective
into consideration, secondary evidence to decision
considerations will almost always arise. For instance,
making a recommendation about the use of remdesivir
in people with non-severe covid-19 at high risk of
hospital admission,30 given a probable important
reduction in the key outcome of hospital admission
and no compelling evidence of serious adverse effects,
a WHO guideline panel made a recommendation

conditional. Panelists make strong recommendations
when they are confident that benefits of an intervention
or comparator clearly outweigh the harms and
burdens of the alternative, and they make conditional
recommendations when the net benefit is less clear
(table 1). We have found a useful way to conceptualise
the distinction between the two situations. When
panelists believe that all or almost all fully informed
individuals would choose a particular option, they make
a strong recommendation. When panelists believe that
an appreciable minority, because of differing values and
preferences, would choose the option not recommended,
they make a conditional recommendation. We have
illustrated this logic in two of the previous examples.
When certainty is low or very low for either benefits
or harms and burdens it is almost always impossible
to have the level of certainty required for a strong
recommendation. As a result, Core GRADE users should
generally avoid making strong recommendations in the
presence of low certainty evidence for key outcomes.
They may, however, consider a strong recommendation
for an intervention when the certainty of evidence for
benefit is low and the likelihood of a bad outcome
of great importance (eg, death, stroke) is very high.
They may make a strong recommendation against an
intervention when there is low certainty of evidence for
benefit and high or moderate certainty for substantial
harm. Supplementary appendix 4 and a previous
GRADE paper provide details and examples of these
and other relevant circumstances.28

the panel to issue a conditional rather than a strong
recommendation for use of the drug.
An AABB guideline panel considering a restrictive (7
g/dL) versus a liberal (9-10 g/dL) transfusion strategy
in patients with anaemia admitted to hospital made
a strong recommendation in favour of the restrictive
strategy.27 For patients, fewer blood transfusions
and thus reduced likelihood of a blood transfusion
represented a benefit of the restrictive strategy. The
supporting systematic review also reported a point
estimate of no difference in mortality between the two
strategies. However, the CI that included an important
1.3% increase in mortality with the restrictive strategy
might have led some very risk averse patients to
choose the liberal strategy and thus have prompted

in favour of the drug. Given the moderate certainty
of evidence on the critical outcomes of benefit, the
recommendation might have been strong were it not for
the requirement for a three day course of intravenous
treatment. For the patient, one could consider the
necessity to come to a facility for the injection on three
consecutive days as a burden, a practical issue, or an
issue of acceptability. However one chooses to look at
it, the requirement is likely to dissuade some people
from using remdesivir. Moreover, the complexity of
establishing or mobilising outpatient facilities for
using intravenous treatment involves challenges and
cost. Finally, the panel noted that differential access
to remdesivir could exacerbate health inequities. The

WE RECOMMEND THE INTERVENTION

Background

Subgroup considerations

Justiﬁcation

This beneﬁt is dependent upon patients and healthcare systems being able to afford and manage the self-testing equipment and patients being able to
make independent decisions about VKA dosing based INR result. The panel felt that PSM was superior to PST as it has shown reduction in mortality.
Although the panel felt like a strong recommendation was warranted based on the available evidence, in settings where resources are limited or when
patients are not willing or able to perform PSM, deviation from this recommendation is appropriate.

a conditional recommendation. While the panelists’
primary focus was the individual patient, they also
considered the population perspective, particularly
stewardship of blood supply. Their concern about
optimising the use of this scarce resource contributed
to the decision to issue a strong recommendation.

Optimised presentation of recommendations
Formulation of recommendations
When presenting recommendations, Core GRADE
users must ensure that their suggestions are clear and
actionable and that they contain explicit information
about the population, intervention, and most often
also the comparison. Core GRADE offers specific
language for strong (we recommend) and conditional
(we suggest) recommendations. Guideline authors
may provide explicit direction for, in the presence
of conditional recommendations, engaging in
shared decision making. They should avoid wording
associated with ambiguity, such as recommendations
“to consider” an intervention.
Core GRADE users should present recommendations
along with their strength and, optionally, with the
associated certainty of the evidence. Box 2 provides
examples of recommendation framing. Figure 3
and figure 4 show alternative approaches of how
recommendations can be phrased, including provision
of succinct accompanying remarks when required.
In general, it is preferable to present recommen­
dations in favour of a particular management approach
(including the comparator in the initial framing
of the population, intervention, comparison, and
outcome) rather than against an approach (typically
the bmj | BMJ 2025;389:e083867 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-083867

the intervention).33 Considering the management of
atopic dermatitis (eczema),31 a joint task force of two
allergy societies compared prescription moisturisers
(initially the intervention) with comparator overthe-counter moisturisers and found their effects to
be similar.32 The panelists believed that the burdens
and acceptability of the prescription moisturisers
warranted use of the over-the-counter preparation,
but instead of recommending against the prescription,
they stated, “In patients with atopic dermatitis, the
Joint Task Force panel suggests using a standard,
bland over-the-counter moisturizer over a prescription
moisturizer medical device.”
Situations do, however, arise when an ineffective or
harmful treatment is in wide use and a recommendation
against that treatment is appropriate. For instance, the
same guideline panel on atopic dermatitis addressed
dilute bleach baths for treatment.31 Its systematic
review and meta-analysis showed that the intervention
was effective in those with moderate-severe disease
but likely provided little to no benefit in those with
mild disease.34 The intervention is burdensome and
associated with adverse effects, albeit usually mild.
The panelists believed that the key message was,
rather than to use the alternative, to avoid dilute bleach
baths in those with mild disease, and so recommended
against the intervention.

Enhancing dissemination of guidelines
Core GRADE aims to make it easier for clinicians
and their patients to make well informed decisions
in practice, using guidelines as tools for decision
support.35 User testing of GRADE based guidelines

In patients receiving maintenance VKA therapy for treatment of VTE, the ASK guidance panel recommends using point-of-care INR testing by the patient
at home and self-adjustment of VKA dose (PSM) over any other management approach, including PST in suitable patients (those who have demonstrated
competency to perform PSM and who can afford this option) (strong recommendation based on low certainty of the evidence about effects).

CORE GRADE: EVIDENCE TO DECISION FRAMEWORKS

underscores the need for optimised presentation and
dissemination of guidelines, summary of findings
tables, and decision aids, in multilayered formats.36 37
Figure 5 shows the living WHO guideline on drugs
for covid-19.30 Available online as open access, it
shows how interactive infographics can provide an
overview of recommendations, with supporting GRADE
summary of findings tables, practical considerations,
and succinct narrative presentations of evidence to
decision issues (refer to user testing infographics).38 39
Figure 3 and figure 4 also show how users can
access the full guideline with all relevant information
(eg, justification, practical issues) in multilayered
formats available online on all devices.40 41 For the
WHO living guideline, this includes tools for shared
decision making, created from GRADE summary of
findings tables and adding practical issues (bottom
panel in figure 3).40 41 This guideline also illustrates
an additional challenge of living evidence: dynamic
updates of recommendations warrants communicating
what is new.42
Creation of digitally structured guideline content
in online platforms, rather than PDF documents,
facilitates publication of multilayered guideline
formats.37 43 44
To further enhance dissemination, guideline groups
can create digitally structured recommendations through
10

websites, pathways, flowcharts, and local protocols
as well as decision support systems linked to patient
data in the electronic health records. These advances
facilitate unhindered access to recommendations at
the point of care. A major challenge, in particular for
GRADE teams working in resource constrained settings,
is the costs of using available online platforms for
authoring and publication.

Conclusion
Core GRADE provides a clear, practical path from
evidence to recommendations and decisions (fig 1).
The approach emphasises the necessity to specify the
perspective (always the individual patient, sometimes
secondarily the population), establish MIDs for key
outcomes, and make explicit the underlying values
and preferences. The approach highlights the key
role of certainty of evidence in determining whether a
recommendation is strong or conditional, and clarifies
primary and secondary considerations in moving from
evidence to recommendations.
