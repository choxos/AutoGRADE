of evidence due to imprecision. Core
GRADE users assess if the true
underlying treatment effect is important
or not in relation to the minimal
important difference (MID) or,
alternatively, if a true underlying
treatment effect exists. The location of
the point estimate of effect in relation
to the chosen threshold determines the
target. For instance, using the MID
thresholds, a point estimate greater
than the MID suggests an important
effect and less than the MID, an
unimportant or little to no effect. Users
then rate down for imprecision if the
95% confidence interval crosses the
MID for benefit or harm.

SUMMARY POINTS
Core GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and
Evaluation) users may assess their certainty in an important or unimportant
effect (using the minimal important difference threshold), which often simplifies
and clarifies ratings of imprecision and interpretation of results
In some situations, when wanting to minimise value judgments, Core GRADE
users may use the null threshold to assess their certainty in a true underlying
treatment effect
When deciding whether to rate down certainty for imprecision, Core GRADE users
will consider whether the confidence interval (CI) crosses the chosen threshold
and will usually rate down two levels if the CI includes both an important benefit
and an important harm
If the CI does not cross a threshold but the effect is very large, Core GRADE users
will consider rating down for imprecision if the sample size or number of events
are too small (ie, not meeting the optimal information size)

This is the second paper in a series describing the
essentials of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation) in rating
certainty of evidence and grading recommendations,
focusing on evidence addressing alternative care
options from the perspective of the patient. In the first
paper, we described our overall Core GRADE approach,
noting that Core GRADE’s certainty rating represents
confidence that the true effect lies on one side of a
threshold (such as an important difference) or in a
particular range (such as an unimportant or little to no
effect).1 We further noted that randomised controlled
trials start as high certainty evidence in Core GRADE’s
four category certainty approach (high, moderate,
low, and very low), and non-randomised studies of
interventions (observational) start at low certainty.
This paper comprises two parts. The first part
describes a key element of the Core GRADE approach:
choosing the target of the certainty rating—that is,
what it is in which we are rating our certainty.2 3 The
second part provides guidance on decisions about
rating down for imprecision—one of the five domains
that Core GRADE users consider when assessing the
certainty of evidence in both randomised controlled
trials and non-randomised studies of interventions.4
The following papers in this series deal with the other
four domains.
The information in this article will enable Core
GRADE users to make choices about whether to
assess their certainty in an important or unimportant
effect, or assess their certainty in a true underlying
treatment effect; make judgments about rating down
certainty of evidence once or twice for imprecision by
considering the width the confidence interval (CI) and
the appropriate plain language summary; and decide
when and how to consider the optimal information size
in making judgments about rating down certainty of
evidence for imprecision.

Target of the certainty rating
When assessing the effect of an intervention, the
primary interest is whether it outperforms alternatives
such as standard care or other existing treatments. If
no difference exists in benefit outcomes, a guideline
panel will unlikely recommend and clinicians will
unlikely use the new treatment unless it offers other
advantages, such as reduced harms or burdens.
Moreover, merely identifying the presence of an effect
is often insufficient to recommend a treatment: patients
and clinicians need to know whether the effect is large

enough to be important. The question of whether there
is an effect compared with the alternative corresponds
to using the threshold of null effect, whereas the
question of whether the effect is important aligns
with using the minimal important difference (MID).
The MID, a crucial concept in clinical studies and
Core GRADE methodology, represents the smallest
change in a single outcome that patients perceive as
important.5
The focus of Core GRADE is on these two questions:
whether there is an effect compared with the
alternative (ie, using the null threshold) and whether
the effect is large enough to be important for patients
(ie, using the MID) (fig 1). Use of additional thresholds
of moderate and large effects has proved challenging
for GRADE users and in our judgment does not provide
important incremental value in making sound and
optimally useful ratings of certainty. Nevertheless,

supplementary appendix 1 presents judgments of
small, moderate, and large effects that Core GRADE
users may sometimes want to consider but are not part
of Core GRADE.6
Deciding what it is in which we are rating our
certainty requires three steps (fig 2). For the first step,
Core GRADE users choose if they are interested in
whether an effect is or is not important, or whether a
true underlying effect compared with the alternative
exists.
For the next step, Core GRADE users establish the
effect estimates through meta-analysis. An important
choice they face is whether to use fixed effect or
random effect statistical models in their analysis.
Supplementary appendix 2 provides key issues with
the approaches.
In rating certainty of evidence, Core GRADE users
typically consider absolute rather than relative effects.

RESEARCH METHODS AND REPORTING

Assessing if the effect is or is not important (using
MID threshold)
When considering whether an effect is important,
Core GRADE users must focus on absolute (ie, risk
differences) rather than relative effects. The reason is,
as we explained in the first article in this series, it is
absolute rather than relative effects that are important
to patients—a 50% relative risk reduction (risk ratio
of 0.5) could represent a 1% absolute reduction
(from a baseline risk of 2% in control group to 1% in
intervention group) or a much larger 20% absolute
reduction (from 40% to 20%).
If Core GRADE users are interested in whether an
effect is important, they will thus need to make a value
judgment about the importance of the outcome, and, in
particular, the threshold that delineates an important
from an unimportant effect (ie, the MID). The values
and preferences that drive this choice should be those
of the patients or other target populations, such as the
general public.
Guideline development and health technology
assessment require judgments about how people value
the benefits, harms, and burdens of the interventions
under consideration. Specifying MIDs, using either
established MIDs (most likely to be available for patient
reported outcomes such as pain, functional status,
or quality of life5 8) or their own estimates (generated
from, for example, existing literature or their clinical
experience9) has proved helpful in facilitating
the trade-offs between desirable and undesirable
consequences of interventions. In the seventh and
final article in this series we address in some detail the
issues of choosing MIDs for key outcomes.10
If Core GRADE users have chosen the MID threshold,
and the point estimate from the meta-analysis
represents an effect greater than the MID ((a) in figure
3), systematic review authors will rate their certainty
that the true effect is an important benefit (or, if
favouring the comparator, an important harm). If the
point estimate represents an effect less than the MID
((b) in figure 3), they will rate their certainty in an
unimportant (little to no) effect.3
Assessing whether a true underlying treatment
effect exists (using null as threshold)
For several reasons, the null represents an alternative
threshold to the MID in systematic reviews. Evidence

Evaluation; MID=minimal important difference

population of interest is typically limited, making
inferences about the MID challenging. Furthermore,
systematic review authors may not see their mandate
as including the search and interpretation of relevant
evidence about MIDs. Finally, systematic review
authors may want to leave the value judgments
involved in choosing specific MIDs to health technology
assessment and guideline practitioners who typically
consult a wider group of individuals, and often in a
structured way.
If Core GRADE users have chosen the null they
will, based on where the point estimate falls in
relation to the null, typically rate certainty that a true
beneficial or a harmful effect exists. If, however, the
point estimate is near the null, because the intuitive
inference in such situations is that the true effect
represents little to no difference between intervention
and control, they will rate their certainty in an
unimportant effect ((b) in figure 3).11 So, although
choosing the null usually avoids specifying MIDs,
it will not always do so. Supplementary appendix 4
provides an expanded discussion of this issue. The
difficulty in altogether escaping considerations of
importance when choosing the null as a threshold
may lead Core GRADE users to prefer the MID as a
threshold.

Rating certainty of evidence: imprecision
After deciding on the target of certainty rating, Core
GRADE users assess whether limitations exist in any
one of five GRADE domains (imprecision, inconsistency,
risk of bias, indirectness, and publication bias). The
following discussion addresses how Core GRADE users
can make judgments about imprecision.
Imprecision defined
Studies of interventions seek to estimate the true
underlying treatment effect. A meta-analysis provides
our best estimate of the effect (the point estimate), and
the CIs provide the bounds within which the true effect
plausibly lies. The most commonly used CI is the 95%
CI. The CI’s width provides key information about the
extent of imprecision, thus informing the impact of
random error on certainty of evidence.

For binary outcomes, Core GRADE users obtain the
best estimate of the risk difference and its 95% CI by
applying the relative risk to an estimate of the baseline
risk. Supplementary appendix 3 illustrates how this
is done. A subsequent paper in this series focusing
on summary of findings tables presents additional
information about absolute effects and how to present
continuous outcomes.7
Finally, Core GRADE users assess the magnitude of
the absolute effect estimate in relation to the chosen
threshold. The process for these steps is discussed
further below and illustrated in figure 2.

and Evaluation; N=number of participants; OIS=optimal information size

We will now describe our approach to making the
judgment of whether the CI is sufficiently wide that
Core GRADE users should rate down for imprecision,
and whether they should rate down by one or two
levels. As judgments about rating down once or twice

have proved challenging for GRADE users, in the
current discussion we build on clarification in previous
papers.4 6 Figure 4 presents the steps Core GRADE users
take in making these judgments.

or above the null) affects the rating of imprecision. (a) Core GRADE users will not rate
down for imprecision in either case. (b) If the target of certainty rating is an important
effect (above the MID), Core GRADE users will rate down for imprecision, but they will
not if the target of certainty rating is an effect above the null. (c) Core GRADE users
will rate down for imprecision in both cases. GRADE=Grading of Recommendations
Assessment, Development and Evaluation; MID=minimal important difference

Rating down (or not) for imprecision
When deciding whether to rate down certainty for
imprecision, Core GRADE users will consider whether
the CI crosses the chosen threshold. For instance,
consider the pooled effect estimate from a hypothetical
systematic review of randomised controlled trials
illustrated in figure 5. For (a) in figure 5, whether Core
GRADE users are rating certainty for a non-null effect
(null being a risk difference of 0%) or an important
effect (the MID threshold of 1%), the CI does not cross
either threshold and they will not rate down their
certainty for imprecision. Assuming they have no
concerns about the other four GRADE domains, they
will have high certainty of a non-null effect as well as
an important effect.
For (b) in figure 5, decisions about rating down
certainty will differ depending on the threshold. When
using the null, as the CI does not cross the threshold,

Fig 6 | An example of how rating down for imprecision in Core GRADE depends on the
choice of MID in a systematic review of corticosteroids versus no corticosteroids on
mortality in patients with community acquired pneumonia. If the review authors set the
MID at MID1, they will rate down for imprecision, and if they set the MID at MID2, they
will not rate down for imprecision. GRADE=Grading of Recommendations Assessment,

Core GRADE users will not rate down their certainty for
imprecision. When using the MID, as the CI crosses the
threshold, they will rate down for imprecision.
For (c) in figure 5, whether Core GRADE users are
rating their certainty in relation to the null or the MID,
the CI crosses the threshold and they will rate down for
imprecision.
Consider a systematic review of corticosteroids
versus no corticosteroids for patients with community
acquired pneumonia (fig 6).12 The meta-analysis
of randomised controlled trials reported that
corticosteroids yielded 29 fewer deaths per 1000
patients, with a CI from 52 fewer to 6 fewer. If review
authors have chosen the null as their threshold, they
will rate their certainty that a true mortality reduction
exists and will not rate down for imprecision.
If review authors have chosen the MID as their
threshold and set the MID at a difference of 10 deaths
per 1000 patients (MID1 in figure 6), because the
point estimate is greater than the threshold, they will
rate down their certainty in an important mortality
reduction. Had they chosen an MID of 5 deaths per
1000 patients (MID2 in figure 6), they would not rate
down for imprecision because the CI does not cross the
MID threshold.
When Core GRADE users have chosen the MID as
their threshold and the point estimate is less than
the MID, they will rate their certainty that the true
treatment effect is unimportant (ie, little to no effect)

Rating down once or twice for imprecision
As the CI gets wider, Core GRADE users will become
progressively more uncertain about whether the truth
is consistent with an important or unimportant effect,
or whether it reflects a non-null effect. To reflect the
degree of uncertainty influenced by imprecision of
evidence, Core GRADE users can consider rating down
one or two levels for imprecision.
A role for plain language statements in making
decisions
Stating results in plain language that both clinicians
and patients will easily understand is important in
making Core GRADE optimally useful for clinical
practice. GRADE has therefore provided guidance in
making such statements (table 1).13 We will return to
these statements in the sixth paper in this series, in
which we discuss Core GRADE summary of findings
tables; we introduce them here because they can help
decide on rating down once or twice for imprecision.8
Rating down once or twice for imprecision: general
principles
When deciding whether to rate down twice, two
things are worth considering. The first is whether the
CI crosses more than one threshold (eg, includes both
important benefit and important harm). The second,
considering Core GRADE’s plain language, is whether
the most appropriate message that a particular effect
likely exists or that it may exist.
Consider a systematic review comparing reduced
versus standard dose corticosteroids for patients with
vasculitis. For the outcome of mortality, the authors
report a reduction in deaths of 21 per 1000 and a 95%
CI that includes a 60 per 1000 reduction but also a 36
per 1000 increase (fig 8). If the authors used an MID
of 1% they would rate their certainty in an important
effect. Given that the CI crosses the MID threshold they
would rate down for imprecision.
Moreover, the width of this CI would prompt
the review team to consider rating down twice for
imprecision. Indeed, because the CI not only crosses
the MID for benefit but also includes an important
harm, they would rate down twice for imprecision.
Thus, even before considering any other reason for
rating down, the authors have only low certainty
evidence that the lower dose regimen results in an

(all point estimates in figure 7). As described in the
section on assessing whether there is a true underlying
treatment effect, when Core GRADE users have chosen
the null as the threshold and the point estimate clearly
suggests an unimportant effect (ie, the point estimate
is close to the null) they will instead rate certainty
in little to no effect by relating the CI to the MID (see
supplementary appendix 4 for further illustration).
In either case, they will not rate down for imprecision
if the CI crosses neither threshold ((a) in figure 7). If
the CI crosses one threshold ((b) and (c) in figure 7) or
both thresholds ((d) in figure 7) they will rate down for
imprecision.

important reduction in mortality (the target of their
certainty rating).
The second consideration that bears on the
decision about rating down once or twice has to do
with the most suitable plain language statement that
accompanies the certainty of evidence. Consider the
example of corticosteroids for patients with vasculitis
that includes a CI ranging from a 6% reduction to a
3.6% increase. Assuming systematic review authors do
not have concerns on the other Core GRADE domains,
would it convey the optimal message about certainty
stating that the lower dose regimen likely results in
an important reduction in mortality (the statement
that would accompany rating down once) or that it
may result in an important reduction in mortality (the
statement that would accompany rating down twice).
If the review authors considered the latter statement
more appropriate (as in our view they should) they
would rate down twice for imprecision. This highlights
that it can be useful for Core GRADE users to consider
what would be the most appropriate statement to
communicate to their target audience.
The two considerations also apply to imprecision
judgments when Core GRADE users choose the null
as the threshold of interest. For example, consider a
situation in which users rate their certainty in a benefit
(threshold the null) but the CI also includes clearly
important harm. The finding that the CI is consistent
with both benefit and important harm motivates a
plain language summary stating that the intervention

“may” result in a benefit, and rating down two levels
for imprecision.

Fig 8 | An example of using Core GRADE to rate down two levels for imprecision in a
systematic review of different doses of corticosteroids on mortality in patients with
vasculitis. Since the confidence interval includes both important benefit and important
harm, the review authors should consider rating down two levels for imprecision.
GRADE=Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation

Rating down for imprecision when effects are large and
sample size limited
When the CI crosses the threshold or thresholds
of interest, Core GRADE users will rate down for
imprecision and do not need to consider sample size.
If the CI does not cross the threshold, however, and
the effect is large, they must be aware that large effects
are unusual in interventions tested in randomised
controlled trials. Attempts to replicate results of early
studies suggesting such effects often fail. Thus, we
suggest that when the CI does not cross the threshold
or thresholds of interest and effects on binary outcomes
are implausibly large (certainly relative risk reduction
>40%, possibly >30%), Core GRADE users should
consider rating down for imprecision if the sample size
and number of events across all contributing studies
are limited.
Our criteria for “limited” rely on routine sample size
calculations that would be undertaken when planning
a single randomised controlled trial (see supplementary
appendix 5). For binary outcomes, these involve
specifying the acceptable error rates: α (typically 0.05)
and β (typically 0.20), the control group event rate
(chosen from the context), and a modest relative risk
reduction, typically 20% or 25%. We call the sample
size that emerges from the calculation the optimal
information size (OIS). If the total sample size of all the
studies included in a meta-analysis exceeds the OIS,
one does not rate down; if the total sample size proves
less that the OIS, one rates down for imprecision.
Core GRADE users can consult one of many online
calculators to calculate a particular OIS (eg, https://
www.openepi.com/SampleSize/SSCohort.htm).
Core GRADE users can make the same calculation
for continuous variables by specifying the smallest
difference between intervention and control that one
would want to avoid missing (ie, the MID), and using
the standard deviation from one of the existing studies.
An alternative, a rule of thumb, would suggest that to
not have concerns about imprecision (ie, to not rate
down) would require 400 patients per group (total
sample size 800). A previous GRADE article14 and
supplementary appendix 5 provide further details
and examples of OIS exploration for both binary and
continuous variables.

Conclusion
The process of assessing the certainty of evidence
requires choosing a threshold, either the null or the
MID, and then choosing the target of certainty by
noting the location of the point estimate in relation to
the threshold. When the initial choice of threshold is
the null, if the point estimate is close to this threshold,
Core GRADE users rate certainty in little to no effect.
For judging imprecision, if the CI does not cross the
threshold, Core GRADE users typically do not rate
down for imprecision; if it crosses the threshold, they
do. Core GRADE users may rate down twice when the CI
crosses more than one threshold, in particular when it
crosses thresholds of important benefit and important
harm. Finally, when the CI does not cross the threshold
but the effect is large, Core Grade users invoke the OIS
and rate down for imprecision if the total sample size
fails to meet the OIS criterion.
