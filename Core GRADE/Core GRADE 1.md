SUMMARY POINTS
Core GRADE provides guidance for comparing a single intervention with a single
comparator
Core GRADE takes primarily an individual patient rather than a population or
public health perspective
Core GRADE deals with two fundamental processes: judging the certainty of
evidence for each important outcome as presented in a summary of findings
table, and moving from evidence to recommendations that have both a direction
(for or against) and a strength (strong or conditional/weak)
The first step in the GRADE approach is to explicitly define the question using the
PICO (population, intervention, comparison, outcome) format and then to refine
the question considering the possibility of both subgroup differences in relative
effect and large differences in baseline risk across patient groups
the bmj | BMJ 2025;389:e081903 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-081903

effects across patient groups. The
article then provides an overview of the
remainder of the Core GRADE approach,
including decisions about the certainty
of the evidence and considerations in
moving from evidence to guidance and
recommendations.
This is the first paper in a series describing Core
GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment,
Development and Evaluation)—the fundamentals
that authors of systematic reviews, health technology
assessment reports, and clinical practice guidelines
require to use the Core GRADE approach to rate certainty
(quality, confidence) of evidence and grade strength
of recommendations. Although the series focuses on
evidence comparing a single intervention with a single
comparator and takes an individual patient’s perspective,
the underlying principles also apply to evidence and
decisons from a population or public health perspective.
Figure 1 depicts each of the key steps in using Core
GRADE to create clinical practice guidelines or health
technology assessment reports: summarising the
evidence, rating its certainty, and moving from evidence
to recommendations. We then provide details of the
first steps in this process—formulating and refining the
clinical question. Finally, we present an overview of
the subsequent steps: rating the certainty of evidence
and preparing tables with a summary of the findings.
Subsequent papers in this series will address each of
these key steps in detail. Supplementary Appendix 1
provides plain language definitions of key GRADE terms.
The information in this article will enable Core
GRADE users to understand the scope and aim of this
new series; describe Core GRADE’s approach to rating
certainty of evidence and summarising the evidence in
systematic reviews, clinical practice guidelines, and
health technology assessment reports; frame questions
using the population, intervention, comparison,
outcome (PICO) format, with consideration of possible
differences across subgroups of patients and the
possible need to seek indirect evidence; and describe
Core GRADE’s approach to moving from evidence to
recommendations.

The GRADE approach
Core GRADE applies to the design, conduct, and
analysis of systematic reviews as well as to the use

of their results in moving from evidence to decisions
in clinical practice guidelines or health technology
assessment.1 In figure 1, the left panel addresses the
systematic review process, including the definition of
the review question formulated using the PICO format
with specification of the relative importance of each
of the components, followed by the collation and
summarisation of the evidence, including ratings of
certainty (quality) of the evidence for each outcome.
The right panel depicts the decision making
process involved in the development of clinical
practice guidelines and health technology assessment
reports. That process involves a guideline panel or
decision making group that considers key issues of
magnitude of benefit, harms and burdens, certainty
of evidence, and patient or public values and
preferences. Decision makers might also consider
costs, feasibility, acceptability, and equity in coming to
recommendations either for or against an intervention
and further specifying recommendations as strong or
conditional (weak).

When we refer to recommendations we mean not
only the highly structured guidance GRADE suggests
for clinical practice guidelines but also the less
formally structured guidance that health technology
assessment reports typically provide for their target
decision makers. Although we focus our discussion on
the structure of the guideline development process, it
is also relevant to health technology assessment and,
excepting the process of moving from evidence to
recommendations, to systematic reviews.

Formulating the question
All applications of GRADE, whether for systematic
reviews, health technology assessment reports,
or clinical practice guidelines, begin with the
identification of a clinical question using a
structured process to specify the relevant population,
interventions, comparisons, and outcomes of potential
importance to patients—the target PICO.
Optimal use of GRADE involves careful thought
about the formulation of each element of the PICO

structure, being as specific as possible and avoiding
ambiguity.

Rating the importance of outcomes
Core GRADE users will initially strive to identify all
outcomes that are potentially important to patients
and subsequently consider those of sufficient
importance. Guideline panels in particular may
undertake a structured process to rate the importance
of potentially relevant outcomes. In doing so, they will
adopt the perspective of the population to which the
guideline applies and may use a 9 point scale, with
ratings of 7 to 9 representing critical outcomes, 4 to 6
representing important but not critical outcomes, and
1 to 3 representing unimportant outcomes.3 4 Ideally,
they would make this rating informed by a systematic
review of patient values and preferences, and, if
resources permit, a focus group of relevant patients.5

Refining the question: possibly different effects across
population, intervention, or outcome definitions
Core GRADE users will further refine the clinical
question, considering the possibility that treatment
effects differ across population, intervention, or
outcome characteristics. In the past, GRADE users have
often shown confusion between relative and absolute
effects, and we will here clarify this problem in some
detail. Furthermore, systematic review authors and

Population, intervention, and comparison
In the past, GRADE users have often lacked precision
in how they specify their target PICO. The careful,
explicit, and transparent specification of the target
PICO represents a key aspect of Core GRADE. In
particular, Core GRADE users must be as precise as
possible when defining the target population.
Including a GRADE expert explicitly charged with
helping systematic review teams and guideline panels
to formulate their PICOs has proved helpful in achieving
the desired precision. The GRADE expert should work
with a steering group that translates broad questions
generated by the panel into detailed structured
questions. The steering group will subsequently help
the panel consider differences between its target
population and patients enrolled when the Core
GRADE approach considers issues of indirectness. The
fifth paper in this series addresses these issues.
Regarding choice of the population, the methods
expert group of a World Health Organization (WHO)
panel (with the function of a steering group in other
settings) addressing the management of sepsis
confronted problems in arriving at a precise definition—
problems the GRADE expert on the group highlighted.
Core GRADE users will often encounter studies with
varied definitions of their population. In the current
example, the guideline developers came across several
definitions of sepsis, including a revised consensus
definition that differed from that used in individual
trials, which also differed from one another. To resolve
the problem of such discrepancies, the panel used the
most recent consensus definition of sepsis, recognising
that the greater the extent to which eligibility criteria
in the trials differed from the consensus, the greater
the possibility that the evidence included in the review
would not reflect the target population (and thus, in
GRADE terminology, would introduce indirectness).
Supplementary appendix 2 presents another
example of the need for careful specification in defining
the PICO and highlights how authors must think ahead
to the needs of their target audience when formulating
the research question.2

In the hypothetical guideline depicted in figure 1,
panelists identified six outcomes of potential relevance,
of which they judged two as critically important, two as
important, and two as not important. They would give
no further attention to the two outcomes considered
not important while continuing to consider the other
four.
Outcomes of importance can differ across the stages
of an illness. For example, an Infectious Diseases
Society of America guideline panel addressing patients
admitted to hospital with covid-19 considered the
most important outcomes (those GRADE labels as
critical) as mortality, need for invasive mechanical
ventilation, and duration of hospital admission.6
For outpatients with covid-19, the panel considered
hospital admission as a critical outcome. For patients
receiving pre-exposure or postexposure prophylaxis,
critical outcomes included measures of symptomatic
covid-19.
Another crucial problem in considering outcomes
is the relevant time frame: days, months, or years,
and, whatever chosen, how many? In the WHO sepsis
guideline, for all the wide variety of interventions
under consideration (eg, corticosteroids, inotropes,
different starting times for antibiotics) and outcomes
(eg, mortality, adverse effects of treatment, functional
recovery), the panel considered several alternatives:
during hospital admission, the first month after
hospital admission, or a considerably longer timeframe
(eg, six months). The panel decided on the 28 days
after hospital admission as the primary duration of
interest and six months as a secondary duration.
Because the lowest certainty of evidence of the
critical outcomes informs overall certainty of evidence,
guideline panels—and the systematic reviews created
to inform a specific guideline—need to distinguish
between critical outcomes and important but not
critical outcomes. Often, however, systematic review
authors perform reviews independently of practice
guidelines or health technology assessments. Although
most problems faced by these independent reviews do
not differ from reviews specifically conducted for health
technology assessments or guidelines, one that does
concerns differentiating between critical and important
but not critical outcomes. Because systematic review
authors do not need to make definitive judgments
regarding the balance of benefits, harms, and burdens,
they do not need to judge the relative importance of
the outcomes they have chosen. In particular, they do
not need to distinguish between critical outcomes and
important but not critical outcomes.

CORE GRADE: OVERVIEW
in postulating subgroup relative effects and specify
a direction for each postulated effect. For example,
authors should not only identify that effects may
differ in patients according to their age but also, for
instance, that the intervention effects will be larger in
elderly people than in younger people. Large numbers
of hypothesised subgroup effects and failure to specify
their direction will undermine the credibility of any
apparent subgroup effect. A later article in this series
addressing inconsistency in results across studies
returns to the problem of credibility of subgroup
effects.
Although relative effects are usually similar across
patient subgroups, absolute effects of interventions will
differ noticeably when subgroups of untreated patients
have different probabilities (different baseline risks)
of the outcomes of interest. For example, a treatment
associated with a consistent relative risk reduction of
50% might reduce mortality in young people without
comorbidity from 2% to 1% (absolute difference 1%)
and in old people with comorbidity from 40% to 20%
(absolute difference 20%). Such differences, although
perhaps not often of this magnitude, are common.
This is the reason that absolute and not relative
effects are important to patients: young people in this
example might be reluctant to use an intervention
with substantial harms, whereas old people will likely
be more inclined to do so. Supplementary appendix
3 presents an exercise in distinguishing between
prognosis (baseline risk) and relative risk as sources of
difference in absolute effects across groups.
Ideally, panels and review teams will specify a small
number (≤3) of relative subgroup effects including
a postulated direction. Core GRADE users may also
anticipate different recommendations for groups
at different baseline (absolute) risks and this might
result in different recommendations—for example,
recommendations in favour of an intervention for
patients at higher risk and against for patients at lower
risk.

guideline for covid-19 therapeutics,14 when making

guideline panels have generated an excessive number
of hypotheses and have failed to specify the direction of
effect. In addition, they have often failed to recognise
that differences in relative effect across subgroups of
patients are unusual and have been ready to judge the
credibility of subgroup effects as high when they are
not.7 8
For binary (yes/no) outcomes such as death and
hospital admission, treatment effects may differ as a
result of differences in relative effects (eg, no effect—
that is, relative risk of 1.0—in one patient group,
relative risk of 0.5 in another), or differences in
prognosis in the comparator group, which we often
refer to as baseline risk. For example, the relative risk
stays the same, but the comparator group event rate—
the baseline risk—is 5% in one group of patients and
20% in another.
For differences in relative effects, authors refer to
factors that could influence the magnitude of effect
using interchangeable terms such as subgroup effect,
effect modification, or interaction. For continuous
outcomes such as pain or length of hospital stay,
typically presented using an absolute difference scale,
effects may also differ across groups. For example, in a
PICO addressing pain using a 10 cm visual analogue
scale, a difference between intervention and control of
3 cm in one patient group and 1 cm in another.
Patient characteristics that may modify either
relative effect or baseline risk include age, severity of
illness, patient circumstances such as socioeconomic
status, and comorbidity. Intervention characteristics
such as dose or duration of administration as well as
outcome characteristics such as alternative outcome
definitions or varying duration of follow-up can also
influence treatment effects.
As they refine their question, GRADE users consider
both relative effects (relative risks, odds ratios, or, for
time to event analyses, hazard ratios) and absolute
effects (risk differences). Relative treatment effects
are, however, most often similar across subgroups—
true subgroup relative effects are uncommon.9-13
Core GRADE users should therefore be parsimonious

with non-severe covid-19, the guideline panel
postulated both possible absolute effects and possible
relative differences between groups (table 1). For each
postulated effect, the WHO panel made the direction of
effect explicit, hypothesising for instance that the effect
of treatment would diminish if the administration of
the intervention were delayed.
The systematic review team reported no credible
relative subgroup effects.15 They did, however, identify
substantial differences in effect between patients with
different baseline risks. In particular, they found that
despite patients with a high and low baseline risk
having the same relative effect, nirmatrelvir-ritonavir
was likely to effect important reductions in both
mortality and hospital admissions in patients at high
risk; in patients with a low baseline risk, benefits were
likely to be trivial. More specifically, the anticipated
reduction in hospital admissions for patients at low risk
was about 4 per 1000 (0.4%) and for those at high risk
was 50 per 1000 (5%). When considering the results
the bmj | BMJ 2025;389:e081903 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-081903

of the systematic review showing the large differences
in effect between patients at low and high risk, the
guideline panel issued a strong recommendation in
favour of nirmatrelvir-ritonavir for patients at high
risk and a weak recommendation against its use for
patients at low risk.

Possible need for indirect evidence
A final problem systematic review, health technology
assessment, and clinical practice guidelines must
consider is the possible need to seek indirect evidence—
that is, evidence from studies with a PICO that does not
completely correspond to the target PICO. This will be
required when teams anticipate direct evidence may
be limited and the highest certainty evidence may be
indirect. For example, early in the covid-19 pandemic,
before evidence was available from randomised
controlled trials, guideline developers addressing
the use of steroids for those with severe covid-19
considered evidence from randomised controlled trials
showing benefit in patients with acute respiratory

CORE GRADE: OVERVIEW

GRADE’s rating of certainty of evidence
GRADE’s certainty rating represents confidence that
the true effect lies on one side of a chosen threshold
(such as an important difference) or in a particular
range (such as a small effect).18 Core GRADE presents
a four category system of rating certainty as high,
moderate, low, and very low. Although Core GRADE
certainty ratings rely on evaluation of individual
studies, they refer to the entire body of evidence
addressing a particular outcome rather than those
individual studies.
Figure 2 summarises the Core GRADE approach to
rating certainty of evidence for intervention effects.
If the evidence comes from randomised controlled
trials, ratings begin as high certainty. In contrast, a
body of evidence from non-randomised studies of
interventions (eg, cohort and case-control studies)
begins as low certainty. Certainty in the evidence from
both randomised controlled trials and non-randomised
studies decreases when limitations are identified in
any one of five domains: imprecision, inconsistency,
risk of bias, indirectness, and publication bias. Core
GRADE users can rate up certainty in non-randomised
studies (but not randomised controlled trials) for large
effects and for evidence of a dose-response gradient.
Previous GRADE guidance that included the possibility
of rating up as a result of predictable direction of
plausible confounding has proved too difficult to apply
and too rarely applicable to be part of Core GRADE.
We characterise limitations in each of these domains
involved in rating down certainty as not serious;
serious; very serious; or, rarely, extremely serious. The

Low

loss of certainty will result in rating down once for a
particular domain (for example, from high to moderate
certainty) if concerns are serious, and twice for a
domain (for example, from high to low) if concerns are
very serious.
Although GRADE has divided certainty of evidence
into four categories, certainty is actually a continuum.
As a result, one may, when rating is near a cut-off
point between categories, have disagreements about
certainty when judgments are in fact similar (fig 3).
In terms of ratings near a cut-off point, the same
phenomenon can occur when deciding whether to
rate down in any one domain. Ratings may be near the
cut-off point between no serious and serious concerns
(potentially mandating rating down one level) or
between serious and very serious (potentially rating
down two levels) (fig 4).
To illustrate the potential problem, consider the
following scenario. While summarising certainty of
evidence for randomised controlled trials, the rating
is near the threshold between no serious and serious
limitations for three domains, with no problems in the
other two domains. Erring on the side of not rating
down, one might not rate down for any of the three and
emerge with high certainty evidence. Erring on the side
of rating down, one might rate down for all three and
emerge with very low certainty evidence.
In this situation, one might consider the magnitude
of the problems in the three domains, conclude that
the certainty of evidence is near the threshold between
moderate and low certainty, and ultimately decide
to either rate down once and conclude moderate
certainty evidence or rate down twice and conclude
low certainty evidence. Such a situation illustrates the
necessity for, after considering each of the individual
domains, stepping back and taking an overall view of
the threats to certainty of evidence.
For example, in the WHO’s living guideline for
covid-19 therapeutics14 recommendation about
lopinavir-ritonavir versus standard care for mortality
and mechanical ventilation, the review team identified
problems with both inconsistency and imprecision
for mortality and mechanical ventilation outcomes.
In both cases, however, the problems were near the
threshold between not serious and serious (fig 4) and
thus were not so serious as to warrant rating down
for both domains, with consequent low certainty of

distress syndrome whose clinical presentation is
similar to that of critically ill patients with covid-19.16
The panel decided that although the evidence was
limited by indirectness, it warranted a conditional
recommendation for use of steroids in patients with
severe covid-19.17
Having decided on their PICO question and any
subgroup hypotheses (based on either different
baseline risks or different modifiers of relative effects),
systematic review teams will, as depicted in figure 1,
proceed to summarise the effects of the interventions
of interest on the outcomes of interest in the patients
of interest and then judge the associated certainty of
evidence.

evidence (ie, rating down from high to low). Thus, the
overall view for mortality and mechanical ventilation
was that the evidence was of moderate certainty. The
panel noted that concerns in both inconsistency and
imprecision domains led to the rating down from high
to moderate certainty evidence. These thoughtful
judgments reflect the strength of Core GRADE:
the facilitation of a thoughtful and deliberative
assessment of evidence within a sound, carefully
considered, transparent structure that allows for
flexibility.

Completing the GRADE process: evidence summary and
moving from evidence to recommendations
The review team will summarise the evidence in
relative and absolute estimates of effect for each
patient important outcome, including rating certainty
of evidence as high, moderate, low, or very low, using
a GRADE summary of findings table. Such tables may
take a variety of formats, but any format should include
a row for each outcome, and each row should include:
• key details of outcome measurement: the
duration of time to which estimates apply and for
continuous outcomes the scale, what higher and
lower scores indicate, and, if available, a minimal
important difference;
• the number of studies and number of patients
contributing to the estimate of effect on that
outcome;
• relative effects on binary outcomes presented
as odds ratios, relative risks, and associated
confidence intervals, time-to-event outcomes
presented as hazard ratios and associated
confidence intervals;
• for absolute effects, for binary outcomes: the
baseline risk (event rate) in the control group, the
event rate in the intervention group, the difference
between these event rates and the confidence
interval around that difference; for time to event
outcomes: the median survival estimates or
the event rate, or both, at a prespecified time
during follow-up in each of the groups, and the
difference between this estimates or rates with the
confidence interval around that difference; and
for continuous outcomes: the mean in each group
and the difference between groups (typically a
the bmj | BMJ 2025;389:e081903 | doi: 10.1136/bmj-2024-081903

mean difference) and an associated confidence
interval;
• the certainty of the evidence, with an indication of
reasons for rating down if evidence is rated down
from high certainty; and
• a plain language summary that captures the
essential conclusion about the results, including
the associated certainty.
Table 2 presents one way to structure summary of
findings tables—our preferred format and one that
WHO has been using in its guidelines. This example
is adapted from a WHO guideline addressing
nirmatrelvir-ritonavir versus standard care for patients
with non-severe covid-19.14 15 In a later article in this
series we will provide more details on how to produce
summary of findings tables.
For systematic reviews not linked to specific
guidelines or health technology assessment reports,
the GRADE process ends here. For clinical practice
guidelines, the panel then considers the summary
findings table informing its recommendation. An initial
choice is to clearly differentiate the critical outcomes
from the important but not critical outcomes. The
lowest certainty of evidence of the critical outcomes
will constitute the overall certainty of evidence for
each recommendation.
To move from evidence to recommendations, the
panel will consider the relative importance of the
benefit, harm, and burden outcomes summarised in
the summary of findings table. In doing so, they will
consider not their own view of relative importance
but rather the relative importance of the outcomes to
the patients or people to whom the guideline applies.
Core GRADE users make judgments about the relative
importance of outcomes and how, as a result of the
importance, patients will trade-off the benefits versus
harms and burdens as values and preferences. Core
GRADE mandates that the panel provide an explicit
statement of the inferred values and preferences of the
relevant population.
The panel will then address the balance of
anticipated desirable and undesirable effects of the
intervention and comparator, taking into account both
underlying values and preferences and the certainty
of evidence for each outcome. As depicted in figure 1,
the panel will, if relevant to its particular question,

consider cost, feasibility, acceptability, and equity,
arriving at a direction of recommendation in favour
of the intervention or comparator, and a strength of
recommendation as strong or conditional (weak).

Limitations of the Core GRADE approach
We see only one serious limitation in the Core GRADE
approach, and that is the subjectivity involved
in virtually every important decision in rating
certainty of evidence and moving from evidence to
recommendations. This need for subjective judgments
would, however, be inevitable for any useful system
considering certainty of evidence or providing an
approach to move from evidence to recommendations.
The alternative—a mechanical approach offering
never-to-be-broken rules—would result in many poor
judgments and prove unfeasible and unacceptable.
Conclusion
For systematic reviews, health technology assessments,
and clinical practice guidelines, the Core GRADE
approach begins with formulating the relevant clinical
questions using the PICO format. At the same time Core
GRADE users will consider possible relative and absolute
subgroup effects and provide a priori hypotheses about
direction of effect for a small number of potentially
credible effect modifiers. Reviewers summarise the
evidence, including estimates of magnitude of relative
and absolute effects and the certainty of the evidence,
and present their findings in summary of findings tables.
They may do so in the context of supporting a guideline,
supporting other decision makers, or independent of
either. In the decision making context, decision makers
use review results to address core issues of benefits,
harms and burdens, certainty of the evidence, and
patient values and preferences. They do so whether
evidence is high or low certainty, always responding to
clinicians’ and patients’ need for guidance. Depending
on the context, they might in addition consider

8

secondary criteria of cost, acceptability, feasibility, and
equity in deciding on recommending for or against an
intervention versus a comparator, and the strength of
the recommendation as strong or conditional.
